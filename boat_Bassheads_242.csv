boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Overall good package. Fond of this,5.0,"If you want durable earphone, protected from sweat, water. Go for this.Build quality: Very good form factor, braided cable with waterproof coating. Eartips are comfortable and fits nicely, looks durable.Sound: Boat earphone, hence Bass rich, treble and mids could have been better (as I listen music in studio monitors, so I felt, not a big issue)Downsides: Wire seems very durable, but not too thick. Could've been thicker. Extra eartips only 2 small and 2 mediums. Couldve been provided more.Overall you can surely take this if you badly need waterproofing and durability, otherwise 225/152/162 has slightly better sound. But this has volume control keys, thats a plus point."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),After almost1 week right earplug isn't working properly and they are causing so much pain in ears,1.0,"Before these earphones, I used the basic Samsung earphones which were 5 years old.And I am writing this review after 3 days of usage,daily for 3-4 hours.Pros:  1- Crystal clear & loud sound.  5/52- Amazing bass.  5/53-Call quality is fine. 4/54- The wires are braided which make them more durable.  5/5One of the most amazing features is that you get sound control buttons in this earphones which work as a charm.Cons :1- After continuous use for 45-60 mins, they cause pain in ears.2- They are MADE IN CHINA.  I didn't know it before.Edit: After daily usage of almost 1 week, the right earplug is not working properly and they are causing hell lot of pain and itchiness on the ear.I am reducing the rating from 4 stars to 1. Also I have applied for replacement.I really wish, somehow refund would be possible, as I don't want to waste 500 Rs."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best. Using it since a month now!,5.0,"Best for me. If you fall in the middle category, where you don't want the best of the best earphones but also don't want the worst, go for this.Earbuds don't fall from my ears! My ears are kind of weird. Like Amir Khan (lol). (I have had a bad past with regards to this with my previous earphones).Bass is gooood. Sound clarity is also good. Some experts may say the vocal clarity is overshadowed by the bass, but I am okay with that.The clip is very useful in preventing the earbuds from falling. I clip it on my collar.The cable strength is also good. The cable got pulled twice by accident, and nothing happened to the earphones.The mic is also good. I use these earphones to listen to music, watch YouTube, calling, send and listen to voice notes, etc.Best. Cheers!Don't think too much :)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Horrible sound.,1.0,Worst sound. It's like someone is poking you with a needle in your ears. Great design but no use. Got ear pain within two days of using this. Sharp painful sound at higher volumes. Somehow managing with low volumes. Bad bass. Worthless.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Warranty issue.....How to return ?,3.0,"One side of these ear plugs stopped working within 3 weeks.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worstest service in India,1.0,It works properly for just 3 months after it bacames worst than any thing else after claiming my warranty it took to clear 1 month. Even after I got some others used earphone which is also not working. I'm fed up with this earphone now I'm using just for listening songs it isn't working in any call. So while purchasing read review.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Good, but Boosted unnatural bass effect",3.0,"Looking at lot of good reviews, I think the opinion probably differs with people.. Sound quality is definitely better than any low profile earphones, but bass quality seems to be so unnatural, boosted to much that gives pain in the ears.Pros: Ear piece stick to the ear comfortably, Sound quality is decent enough, call quality is goodCons: Boosted bass sound spoils the original music (some may like it) it hurts the ear drum in short time of listening to the songs. `This is the first day review, if my opinion change after some days of usage, will get back to change the rating."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Here are some pros nd cons,2.0,"Here are some pros nd consBass quality goodQuality wise is bestNoice cancellation not so goodI think little bit pricy because i got for 550RSAfter usage of 2 month it was not working from one sideNd this problem happened with 2 of my same product (Boat bassheads 242)After that i call Amazon customer care after 10-15 minutes wait they pic up the call nd told me that I wasn't able to helped you .Firstly you should call on Boat customer care number nd here i call them again after 10 minutes they picked up the call they told me file a complaint against the product nd then we pic up your product nd then it goes to our department house where we are checking what's is the problem nd then we ship your productThis process complete around 18-20 daysIt's make me anxious , whatever i go with them  , let's see what happenThink twice before investing your money 💰"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Avoidable purchase - no reply at warranty complaint,1.0,"On the 7th day the callers voice started cracking, thought it was network issue but later found it was same condition. 9th day caller n me couldn't hear each other. couldn't return/exchange - window closed. Warranty centre closed, no reply from the email id sent to imagine marketing India ."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Mic and buttons stopped working,1.0,"Great earphone, I purchased in ₹549, though currently it is available in ₹499 . Little disappointed.Sound is amazing, cable is not that great, there are 3 buttons available. It is better than mi basic earphone that comes in 399/-You can go for it without any doubt.Edit :-After 7 months of use suddenly it's mic has stopped working and in single attempt it doesn't connect with phone and I have to unplug and plug again to connect with phone. Mic and the buttons stopped working and this is the biggest issue with these earphone. Although sound output is still good. Just after warranty expires its mic stopped working, thats ridiculous with Boat.It also don't have L shaped connector like mi basic earphone, so it's not comfortable while Playing games and connecting to laptop."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Don't think twice, Buy it. It's worth the Price",5.0,"Purchased at 399.Absolutely beast at this price range, and it perform even better with Dolby Atmos. Sound is very loud, bass is just what Indians likes. I normally listen it on 70% to 80% Sound. They are very comfortable to wear the wings don't let the earpiece fall.I have used Sony MDR XB55AP its sound is comparable to this Boat handsfree. I mean Punchy Bass and loud noise. I have Used a range of handsfree from Samsung AKG, Senheizer, Noise, Sony, Motorola, JBL & Philips. In all of these the Bass was main concern except the Sony one and none of them come at this price range.So if you are looking for a cheap handsfree with powerful Bass, punchy sound, crystal clear Voice with noise cancelation, mic and also multi function button with Volume rocker. I would say Go for it.It works with all smartphone that support 3.5mm jack and yes It has zero lag for Game sound like PUBG and COD. So it's also good for playing Battle Royal Games."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Biggest ever BAD.,1.0,"Mids r sharp, painful in ear, not clear vocals and treble. Bass good not best. Plastic used cheap quality. The ear fitting and design very bad for ear. Wire is one side in bud so that it pain ear. Very sharp and thin treble audio and bass is not matching. Very unfit and painful for ear cheap plastic quality design. Artis 400m is much better than this atleas clear vocals and 15mm driver. Money vaste product. Everyone who giving it 5 star even don't know about audio technologies."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Broken product in such a short period of purchasing.,1.0,"Product is good. Sound is good. In short this is nice product.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The quality of sound is good but the companies services are worst,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I bought this product in blue color while it suddenly stopped working after few months and I decided to send it to customer service where I came to know whatever they mention on their website is nothing true nobody comes pick up ghe product ans replace u have to go to the service center crowded with lots of people where they just asked me to fill a form and without even checking the issue just gave me another product which was kept in plastic they asked me to check and take it. I was satisfied but just in few days this replaced product started falling apart. Rubbish now I have to go again and wait for 2 hours to get this solved"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It Was Okay?! But I Prefer Realme buds 2,3.0,"My review after 10 days of heavy usage, and I'm comparing it with my previous Realme buds 2.1. sound quality, its good not that bad, but when my friend heard music from my earphones he commented "" Such a Bad Bass "".And even i think it doesn't have good bass2nd Noice Cancellations, uhm maybe it's better than Realme buds 2 in my opinion3rd build quality, I literally liked its build quality, I mean uhm.. I guess wires are really durable and I hope it lasts for a longer than Realme buds 2, my Realme buds 2 lasted for more than a year and was damaged from the button area, wires got damaged and maybe it's because I keep them in my pocket all the time, which reminds me of4. Dude ! The only reason why I really hate these earphones are  its Really, Really, Really Very Uncomfortable even after 10 days, my ears are still Paining... I was thinking about removing the rubber thing but I usually go for running so I need thatAnd it get tangled a lot ( I keep them in my pockets ).The only Reason why I bought this is because 1 year warranty, but honestly I'm regretting I should have really gone for Realme buds 2 they were awesome, Comfortable, good sound quality ( not excellent obviously, but better than these earphone ), and because of those magnetic tips it used to get tangled very Rarely,.If anyone reading this review, wondering about should you buy it or not then... Uhmm... Honestly give Realme buds 2 a try or even if you are purchasing it I hope it doesn't hurt your ear, anyways Good Luck !"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Uncomfortable and Horrible product,1.0,"It is one of the worst headphones I have ever used in my whole life. I wanted to get one for my calls and some light music and unfortunately fell for the reviews on this product which are a gimmick BTW. The product build quality is quite cheap, worse than those cheap Chinese headphones. They are not at all comfortable for long or even short use because once you put them, it hurts your ears. I had to end up buying another pair of headphones to get rid of these cheap and horrible product. If you are looking for comfort, better music experience for long hours, better go for headphones which are having in ear buds similar to the shape of old Apple earphones. Such in ear headphones which blocks air passing to your ear are neither healthy not comfortable."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Seems like cheap/duplicate product,1.0,"The sound quality is just too pathetic.Cons:On call, we or the other person gets to hear echoSound quality seems like a sasta road-side product...too sharp unbearable notes can be heard while listening to online courses or music.The design is just so bad that it causes ear cartilage pain only after listening to 30 mins.Pros:Lookwise is good (but it no where covers up the above nuances)The seller is good. He gave me replace hassle free...but the replacement ear phones STILL has all the above issues. Only the echo issue has somewhat reduced."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Its good,but is it durable?",3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I bought this in October 2020 and writing the review in September 2021. Nearly 1 year of rough use. The sound quality is very good. Amazing noise cancellation. Fits snuggly in my ears. Since it's orange, I can find it when I forget where I kept them. But slowly wear and tears appeared. I have kept it working with cellotapes. Is it worth the money when it can fall apart with some rough use? Or are we supposed to use our earphones delicately?Anyway, I recommend it to music lovers. Others can try something cheaper."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not suitable for regular music lovers. Ear is paining.,1.0,"I ordered this earphone keeping in view of the reviews. But within one day use, I found that this earphone can harm my ear. Some heating is experienced in both the ears, resulting pain. Found not suitable for regular music lovers. The sound quality,bass quality are not soothing to the ears. So want to replace it with other brand. But replacement with other brand is not available. What to do now. I wasted my 550/- rupees."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Average Product..,3.0,242 is not up to the mark. I already have Bass head 100 which is better than this one. Noice cancellation is not that much great. Only benefit I found is that it has inline mic with volume control.Good in bassTreble is above average but actually I found it a disturbing one compared to bass head 100.Fits in ear with ear clip.The additional clip for dress is also helpful.Good cord length and material is also good.Product wise it need improvement.Delivery and packing is fine.Thank you amazon
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Poor rating only for Bad Customer care service,2.0,"It's a great product considering its price. Good built quality, Sounds is clear and amazing deep bass.Unfortunately the right side stopped working after 2mnths. I have written to info@imaginemarketingindia.com but didn't get any response.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Very bad service of Boat company,2.0,"I brought Boat 242 earphones last week.. Just in a week Right side speaker of earhone stopped working.. I tried to calling to centre, but number is not reachable.. Later i raised a ticket in their warrty claiming website.. Ticket got generated but no one has turned back to me.. Only the on package and specifications it is mentioned as one year warranty in reality no warranty.. If something goes wrong then it is yur mistake.. Im unable to understand wat has to be done to replace the product.. Amazon is also not taking it back.. Please if someone know solution for this please let me know..Product is pretty cool but Very very bad service."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"NOT DURABLE,  GOT DAMAGED IN 2 MONTHS",5.0,"Sound quality is good,  bass quality is good too. Lookwise it is stylish and amazing. But this product is not DURABLE.Got it delivered on 30th september and it's hardly 2 months passed that it has stopped working yesterday. Till now I have purchased 5 Nos. of boat earphones. But I am unhappy with the last two purchases. Same issues with the previous one too,  stop working too soon.Initially, for me they use to be the best- better in quality as well as price but not anymore. Varients have increased with time but the quality didn't. Will not recommend anymore."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Everything Was Totally Truly L!T ... Awesome for listening only bcz it give Equalize song,5.0,"It was just an Awesome sets of earphone with accurate frequency point to listen a song ... Just replacing the ear caps, change the tune & frequency for the listener ...In small pair of ear caps you can hear pure Crystal Clear voice & only it focus on voiceIn medium pair of ear caps u get a sense of Equalize bass, drums, voice (as per song u have/make)In large if it will fit in your ear it will give u complete sense of isolation of song like an large hallIt work like as per a high-Quality headset become sounds as per there change of Padss Cusans ... It's awesome to have it ... Try it u goonna make sure it sense something else in every different ear pads"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best in budget sport earphone,5.0,"If you want the best earphones in the price range of 500, go for this one for sure. The bass and the treble are amazing and you can feel it. Also the earclips provided fit and wont come off. Its like they juat glue to your ears and will never come off, unless you remove them. Fits perfectly.Cons- The build quality. It has a cheap Chinese plastic finish on it. My brother had the other black with red on the boat logo. It looked cheap and very bad. But for 399, what can you expect.So my recommendation would be to buy the carbon black one, as it looks much more better and more luxurious. But the price is 549, for the same earphones, of different colours. You get a metallic finish in this one, but you can spot out the plastic easily.Will keep on updating every month till one year, cause boat products last only one year and after that you have to buy a new one."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Sound is good but not the built,3.0,The built quality is too bad. Cheap plastic quality. Sound quality is decent and above average. I got this for Rs 399 during lightning deal but definitely not a Rs 450 or above product for the quality of plastic used.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),100 % waste.,1.0,Very bad product . Sound clarity is too bad. Just some bass only. Never buy from amazon. If you happen to have a return then they wouldn’t refund you back.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Malfunctioned and stopped working within 2 months.,1.0,"I bought this product in April 2021. Intially, it worked well but right after 3rd week it started malfunction. The volume from my phone started increasing and decreasing by itself when I moved the wire of the earphone. Also, it stopped working after 2 months. I filed a complaint to boat, they exchanged it with the same orange earphone. The new one did the same, followed the same pattern for two months then stopped working. I exchange again and same thing happened again. This time, I am exchanging the product for the 5th time and I am kind of sure it will be repeated this time too.I think the problem is only in this orange variant because I have the same earphone model in green colour and it works well.  BTW, on my experience boat products in general do not last more than 6 months. I would recommend you to choose a different brand and if you buy this product atleast do not choose orange colour."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Top Product in this price!,5.0,This is my review after using a month.Pros:- Easy fit- Good sound- Pretty good Noise cancellation- Provided a small clip to pin the wire to your shirt.Cons:- Can hear non stop for 40 minutes or a hour. then you can get slightly feel the pain. pain is good becasue it will notify to take rest for sometime :)Even though seller mentioned it is waterproof. but still i'm taking care of it by staying away from water and wiping the sweat often.You should buy it without second thought... Happy Purchase!
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Impressive so far,4.0,"Just got this after 1 day ( 1-01-2021), and i can say the quality of the earbuds isn't that great because it feels super plasticky, sound quality on the other hand is one of the best I've heard in this price, i also use realme buds2 and the sound is clearly better and clearer in this one, i listen to loads of EDM so this is on the same level or better than RealMe buds 2 in the bass department.Also the earplugs for extra fitting can be removed, i personally find them irritating so thank god for that, so far so good & will update in the future (Update 8-06-2021, left earpiece has stopped working, i never used it harshly but still it stopped working, it's been happening with every earphone i buy, max use time is 5-7 months)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Shitty product,1.0,"Update : stopped working after 1.4  years .. even after utmost care ..I've only used this earphones indoors and never took them out of my house now I've ever tangled it .. still it stopped working ..Writing this after 6 months of usage... Straight to the point I'd like to say isPreviously I was using mi earphones compared to that , these one have very low bass, if you're a bass lover then don't go for it, but boat bassheads 242 has a crisp and clear audio .. the quality of audio is really clearer but there's very little bass and high amount of treble.. you can see even after 6 months of usage the quality of earphone are as it was when I purchased, build quality is really really amazing.. loved it 🙌🙌"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),9.5 on 10...  The '.5' was taken by the mic😅,4.0,"Bassheads are pretty good at comfort and style💖... It has got a really crispy sound🔊... Ear budds are usefull and clip as well... Perfect for jogging and morning fitness...I found a small demerit--it's mic is a bit unsatisfying, the recording sounds need to be little more clear... When we do phone calls the person on the other line feels some discomfort in hearing our voice...After all.. boAt have made a nice piece of sound... Well done boAt and amazon👍🏼👍🏼💖💖"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Mic doesnot work, warranty is not honoured",1.0,"The Mic of this headphone did not work when I checked it wasn't returnable, when I went to claim warranty they asked me to come in the morning.In morning they said they don't have stock!  Visited 4 times to service centre in 4 months and i am still stuck with faulty headphones. Please avoid they are here to dupe you, their conduct at the service centre was exactly that. ( the service centre is in Mumbai )"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),A YES or a NO depending on what you are looking for.,3.0,"For the price it is definitely a steal. It is light weight and easy to carry around. The color and design is also quite nice. The bass is exceptionally good.However on the flip side there's a bit of static that is very faint at times when you plug it to your phone. Songs that have bass notes sound amazing but any song that doesn't have a heavy bass, sounds pretty off, making the listening experience unpleasant. Songs that have a stronger degree  of treble will sound shrill in your ear. Nonetheless, for the price it is a good bargain."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),boAt Bassheads 242 - Budget King 👑,4.0,"Just received this earphones from boAt and reviewed it.I was using Realme X7 Max smartphone with this earphones and had different results obtained.I played youtube and discovered it that overall the sound is very good but the basshead is Between lower to average section but in this price range the bass is decent.On the other hand, i played songs on Spotify and found that the integration with Spotify is very good and i can feel bass on average level and overall sound quality is very good as always.When i used this earphones on my laptop, i was quite shocked to see that bass was on the higher side and the volume was very as compare to the smartphone results as it was on the lower side.Verdict : You can definitely purchase it under Rs 400-500 as you will get water resistant feature and free carrying pouch with it. Also the wire quality is decent. The overall quality is very good but the bass i think is slightly on the lower side as i amba bass lover and i also found that the maximum volume was slow on my smartphone but high on my laptop so it varies on different devices you are using."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good one.,4.0,"I don't know why everyone is hating this product.  In my opinion it's details are as follows-Pros- 1. It comes with hook that is very good to manage earphone.2. Earphone pouch is pretty decent.3. Earphone fits perfectly in ear without any chance of dropping.4. Sound quality is very good, It's not for very high bass lover, for in my opinion sound is perfectly tuned with treble and bass.5. Ear tips are very comfirtable.Cons- 1. Product quality at this price range is worse. I mean wire quality is very cheap. If you are using it very roughly then it will not last long. REALME BUDS 2 are better then it.2. For bass lover, plz go for REALME BUDS 2, which is best product under 1000.3. There is no noise cancellation, which is not even available in other earphones. So it is not a big issue.That's it. I used almost all earphone. But this is good enough and real me buds 2 is best product to buy."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Another average headphones,2.0,I received a defective product.Headphones jack cover was easily removable.I had attached it with my mobile and later on when tried to take it out cover was coming out.Images are the proofIf brand new headphones have such quality then how will we trust on Boat as brand.I have got Boat Avante 1160 speakerBoat bass head 800 over the ear headphones buy they are good. No problem with them.Realme buds 2 are better than Boat basshead 242 at price of 599 and have magnetic attachment for headphonesHowever whenever I buy a headphone with cable it also have low sound quality or it comes damaged to me.Earlier as well I have returned another headphone which got good reviews from other people who have bought it however it is not the same case with me.Kindly refund the amount so that I can go for other brand.Cable quality is good but final product doesn't seem to have gone from proper checking.Bass is not that good if compared with Realme buds 2
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),An Average product at this cost,5.0,"I have purchased the product after reading the review but sorry to say this product has not at allnfull filled my expectaion at all if i compair it from other priducts like jbl and other iternationl brands. The ear buds dosnot fullybenters in the ear so other sound can be hurd easily if onenis listening any mobile content. As an Indian company I will give 3 star rating. Qyality make 5*, wire jack, clip ,Mic 5star. Volume up and down 2 star only. Max volume 2star. Wire lenghth 3 star. This priduct does not desrev any 5 star ratings.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Faulty jack rapidly detoriated within 10days,1.0,"Bough this and replaced it once, both times the jack was faulty. It rapidly detoriated within 10days of light usage(only at night fr an hour or so) to the point that it used to ring in one side only in most positions of the jack(started with rarely being so, n within 10days became like this). Replacement had the same story. Before this i used to own a boat 225/220 and worked for 2yrs before one side gave out. Returnd the replacement and bought boat bassheads 225/220 and it works perfectly like before.DO NOT WASTE TIME ON THIS MODEL!Go for boat bassheads 220/225(amazon n flipkart show differebt number for same model) its much better in sound quality, material n durability."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Such a premium quality product in this range.,5.0,Sound quality is ear deafening... u can use it with 70-80% more than that u cant ..or u r crazy ...BASS 5/5I feel the price is affordable.5/5The wire are very durable 5/5(Wires with nylon outer cover as of i know )the buttons 5/5I use it as a daily driver in gymit wont come unless u take it out.Cons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and also you feel discomfort whiling using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Great wired earphone, nice features, good sound quality!",5.0,"This earphone comes with great features and good quality. Wires are of good quality, nice bass quality, best in this price band of 399 INR, comes with the bonus feature of exclusive buttons for volume up - down rocker, play - pause music buttons. Sound quality is really good and volume level is sure high. Mic quality is not good at least in normal usage. Otherwise it is a value for money earphone.Update: Boat service is excellent. Once registered on their website, they pick up at doorstep and send replacement in 1-2 days to doorstep along with complete tracking info through message, mail and tracking link. Thanks to Boat for their great care and support!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Just OK, could possibly find better options in the price range",3.0,"So today I got the replaced piece, from the one delivered first, there was a disturbance with movement of the wire, which also means that the earphones won't probably last too long. But the real problem was during calls, the people on the other end complained of a disturbing noise which keeps going on and off. Even with the new ones I got today, if I just rotate the 3.5 mm connector, I can hear some little disturbance which means I might face the same problem probably with these as well but I am not going through the pain of replacing these again, also to be fair I need to test these new ones a little more.The sound quality otherwise is decent, sound a bit too high I think, like 50% is good enough for me and 70-75% is too high and 100% is just not bearable for more than a second!As I said earlier, these are OK, you can buy these and you might be satisfied, but you can also look for other options in this price range."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Don’t buy it,1.0,After purchase with in 2 days the right side of earpiece stopped working then I replaced the product so please be aware not so good also mike quality is very bad. You can only replace the product with same earphones with in 7 days of purchase but no option of return.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It's not at all worth it major flaw in design,1.0,I have I used other boat products and was a happy customer until now. The sound quality is not bad but most likely you will not have a strong connection because of the 3.5mm jack is so slim it tends to come out all the time never stays in place if you have phone back over which we are likely to have. Major flaw in their design don't know if it's cost cutting or some failure to implement sleek design but it makes my purchase useless. Disgrace
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Unwanted noises and not up to the mark sound quality.,2.0,Quality is not up to the mark. Used with my moto one power as well as HP elitebook . Very uncomfortable noises . Sometimes hessy unwanted noises . Not very comfortable in fittings too.Now I need to buy boat 225 . I had it before and much better than this one .Only plus point is volume control and start stop option. This is working fine.I need to refund money and go for another product but only return option is available. I already returned one product but same problem in returned product.Bab buy.. I need refund of money and go for another boat product.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Nice at first but fails soon,1.0,"In the first 4-5 months they will work perfectly and you think you cannot get such sound quality at this price. But after 6 months they started to give  a constant ""husss"" sound. After one more month it was unable to play some notes well (sound distorts while playing some notes).I have to emphasize here that the earphones were very well treated - no major bends etc in the wire - no wear on the product itself. But they will fail after 6-8 months.My previous boat earphones were boat bassheads 200 and some other bassheads in the rs500-600 category. Each of the product failed within 12 months - some failed earlier. My conclusion is that these guys spend money in tuning (Bass good) and celebrity promotions of their products compared to the actual quality of drivers which is the poorest. So after 3 failed products within the warranty I am not going to bother purchasing another boat product again."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best accessory with best pricing.,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   One of the best product, have ever ordered for myselfFits perfectly in my ears,Clip holds the cable not to move around while working,Sound quality is too good.I have been using more than a month.Good brand with great product quality for reasonable price is rare combination. Just go for it👍"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Un considerable, think thrice before you buy it",3.0,"I was glad to buy boat earphones supporting Made in India, but the product did not reached my expectationsThere are many cons like1. Rubber earsfit are not soft and is available only in large size. It does hurts for small eared people. Either discontinue giving them along or provide them in every size.2. Drivers are 10mm still bass is far beyond expectations, it does not have punchy base. Can produce pro level wave vibrations.Pros:1. Design is attractive and appealing Colors.2. Water resistant3. Built Quality is good and cables doesn't tangle.4. Carrying pouch is attractive.I suggest boat to remake them around 1k or near and provide good accessories and balance Treble and bass. It's competitors like Wooky, Infinity, JBL & Skullcandy are really heart winning.Boat Baseheads 225 are in a way awesome like other competatives but they are heavy so is avoided.I wish boat a great future ahead."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Review after 3 months - Awesomeness!!,4.0,"Awesome earphones!Loved every bit of it except one which I will come on to.The ear buds are great quality plastic doesn't feel like its a sub 500 bucks earphone. The rubber tips are smooth and do not hurt the ears. Base quality is awesome being Boat. Wont go to technicalities, many have written about it.Put on the earphones, pump up the volume to say 60-70% and you are liberated from most of the noises around you including your mom or wife calling you! ;)It has a nice inline mic on right earphone wire and has volume control buttons too on it and all of it is very well built. No build quality complains as such. It is totally worth, very lightweight too on ears and keep wearing this and work/play games/listen to music/do light exercises and what not. They do not slip off with any of that, not sure with heavy workouts. Sweat proof protection too! Aur kya chahiye? batata hun ....Now coming to the one con -It has a straight jack and not a L shaped one. So if you have your headset jack in the bottom of your phone and want to keep the phone upright on your say belly and do facebook/twitter or any other similar app which calls for keeping phone upright then that will get uncomfortable and it straightway will effect the durability as the cable will snap sometime if not soon if you press it against your body and keep doing that.So for that, I am really disappointed with what could have been a real winner! If you have the headset jack at top of your phone - damn lucky you are, blindly go for this headset!!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not worth it even if the cost is so low,3.0,"The wire feels robust but it is not tangle free. Some reasons sound was good but later I start hearing a sharp hissing sound like when you say 'this' you will hear thisssssssssss. Very sharp which actually hit me in my brain. I have noticed this in other Boat earphones as well. Secondly, you can't wear it for a long time. Your ear will start hurting by the earphone. Well, I'm going to waste this earphone because I can stand this hissssssssing sound.  This is my honestly, review and it is really upto you to decide what you want to buy."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The best wired ear phone out there!,4.0,"I've used a lot of earphones / head phones. Wired, Wireless.. Top brands like Senheisser, JBL, Samsung and Sony. I have even tried other wired in-ear earphones from boat. None of them are as reliable as this and the key factor here is comfort. Extremely comfortable and causes no pain."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Using this, there's no ear pain, no issues with bass, no compromises on looks! Overall - 9/10",5.0,"Bass, amazing.Sound, really good.Looks, AMAZING.Probably one of my best buys after my Bluetooth earphones broke.One should alwaysss go for earphones by Boat, and esp these because they're literally hassle free (charging the bluetooth ones is a pain) and gives you a good feeling just by looking at it.Got them in blue and they're so pretty omg.For the sound quality, it's amazing too. It's been two weeks that I'm using it and there's no pain in the ear as such, claimed by other reviews.(Obviously one's got to have an earpain if you don't give your ears, a chance to breathe and stuff them with headphones/earphones for the most part of the day, right?)Don't have doubts and scones, just go for it."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good one,4.0,"I was waited for the black and red version of it but i couldn't get that. So i have to stick with sprit lime.  Before gst hike this same product available at 400rs in offer period but it is only available at 499rs even at offer time.Pros1. Good looking2. It has volume button as well as play, pause button3. it has got 3 ear tips for your convenience.4. It also has clip and holder for ear5. It has ipx4 ratingCons1. The play pause button sometimes act as next button sometimes work as play pause confusing mechanism2. It holds perfect but i didn't use that white colour holder if you use that you may feel pain after long time.3. I have used it for gaming continuously for long time but i did gave any issue but i have used it for my online training for one day i had pain in my ears i don't know why.4. The price gets lower in atleast in offer time would be great ."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Cool product!,5.0,"I know.. like all these wires and all can be messy but this one look really cool. I got this lime colour and it's more like neon green vibrant colour & I loved it at once. Earplugs are comfortable coz I am wearing them for an hour now and they don't hurt at all, sound is crisp and clear and bass in music just rocks(tried playing variants) .this has this clip,in that way the earplug wires won't be dangling and strangling. I like these volume controls along with the mic and both,  mic and controls works fine. This one is a stretch resistance and I can see why , and hope it tolerates my rough usage. It also comes with a small pouch were I can keep my earphone and make sure it travels safely with me everywhere.😊"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money product at just Rs.550,4.0,"Build quality was ok. Initially bass was okish. But after audio tuning it felt great. Buttons functioning were gud. Might feel pain in ears if using for long tym due to ""secure ear lock"" not coz of ear piece.Absence of Gold coated Jack felt a bit down.Overall, a totally value for money product at such price point and a real steal deal offer ;-)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),An absolute steal.Great audio and mic quality.,5.0,"These boat bassheads are an absolute steal for this price.I mainly purchased it for the mic,as it's closer unlike many other earphones and it's fulfilled it's purpose.They have a sporty look and a plastic build.The audio quality is outstanding ,and this is by far the best earphones I've had till now.The bass is punchy and the mistimes are well balanced as well.The noise cancellation on this is unreal.They're great for my workouts and sweatproof.Call quality is great and I've had no complains so far.Overall very satisfied with my purchase.Its sporty look might not be for everyone but performance wise it's great."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),BEST THING AVAILABLE AT THIS PRICE !!,4.0,"Amazon Packaging - Packaging was good, the package was not destroyed or daformed in anyways, package was water tight (I know as it was raining 🤔)....Coming to the product package, the colour I chose was the same as shown on preview, comes with a warranty card, manual, two pairs of extra buds (1 small, 1, big) and a sticker.I am using the product for 2 months now, no change in colour or any damage to the microphone wherever, well if it is used roughly, it won't last a year.... Used carefully, it would clearly last 2-4 yearsBass boost is a 4* as can't hear at 85+ volume, noice cancellation is a go, I use it for my classes for 5-6 hours a day straight and it feels good ...But, the ear adjust earpiece hurts after using 3 hours straight so I have to use the product without the earpiece, but it's good for a call or a movie....Totally Can't Complain as this is totally cheap and the best quality avilable till now...(Couldn't share picture because of a glitch)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Honest Review, Don't buy before reading this.",5.0,"In short, this is the lowest priced earphones with full bass and good quality sound. i bought this for general use and sometimes i use it in gym because it do not slip from ears. Better than Mi dual driver earphones.I bought it on March 2021 and still today, its performing very good without any problems.Movies and music experience is very good, its more than i expected. Buy it without worry."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Pathetic post sale services - 3 replacements in less than 3 months - pathetic Quality ?????,1.0,"For all those reading the review and scrolling through to find honest ones, I have had the most pathetic experience with the company, the earphones came in working condition but after a few days the mic stopped working and I visited the service centre to get a new one, after a few days even the replaced one stopped working and frustrated I wrote at info@imaginemarketingindia.com, they were good enough to arrange a pick up from my home location and drop off for the 2nd replacement but seems there is no one professional in the company to brief the customer that a pick has been arranged or even the delivery guy with the complete address of the customer. This ain't enough that even the 3rd earphone went bad ie mic stopped working, I again wrote a mail to at the same address and tried to find out email of the management, again there was a pick up arranged with no communication to me or the courier company about my detailed address which again wasted my and the courier guy's time. They have a customer care number which somehow doesn't connect to a representative. I have no clue, but nobody from the company even writing an email just shows how unprofessional they can be, and I bet seems spooky and eerie has hell that is it humans or ghosts running the company. To top it, they are a billion dollar plus company with some 500+ employees. HENCE IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE AND MENTAL STRENGTH TO DEAL WITH THE COMPANY FOR WARRANTY, GO AHEAD AND BUY THEIR PRODUCTS AT YOUR OWN RISK."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Disappointed! - Good but not as I expected,3.0,"I am disappointed. I recieved earphones with a malfunction. The sound quality is very good, crisp and clear. The mic is working fine. The bass is decent but not as good as I thought after reading the reviews. The malfunction is in the 3D sound. The sound that should come from left earphone come from right earphone and the sound that should come from right earphone comes from left side. You can notice this only if you play BattleGrounds Mobile India using the earphones. If you want to check your earphones then search on Youtube- ""footesteps in Pubg"" the first video of Gaming with Leo channel can help you checking this error. I played it for many days first I thought the problem is in the game but that's not the case. My earphones are faulty. I claimed warranty by calling a number given on the warranty card to activate warranty. Then I registered a complaint them on mail as (e-mail mentioned on warranty card as well as contact no. And website to register complaint). It is my first earphone purchase from boat company and I am disappointed. I am regretting why I skipped buying realme buds 2 just to save some money. Now I am waiting for replacement and they say it may take maximum 20 days to complete the replacement procedure and that too after they check my earphones that if it's faulty or not."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Just fine... can't say good,3.0,"Got the product delivered today. It's just an average earphone. The sound quality is good and also plugs into the ears just perfectly, thus cancelling outside sounds totally. The wire is quite long but is not tangle resistant. Gets tangled very easily. The multi function button works only for calls i.e to pick or cut calls and control call volume. It does not work while playing video or music (though it displays paly/pause symbol). But I got it for 449/- , so for this price I guess it's fine and serves my purpose. So not returning it. It also comes with 2 pairs of extra ear buds and a small carry pouch."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Good sound, but..",4.0,"This is my second pair of BoAts and I really like their products. The sound quality is good. Just that with this pair, it’s little weird that the ‘play and pause’ button works with my iPhone but doesn’t work with RedMi phone. I mean it’s really weird, again I tested with both music and calls. The issue happens with music player on RedMi phone.The issue isn’t grave but sometimes I feel it should have worked well regardless of the device you’re listening music on.I feel proud of BoAt being an Indian company and really look forward to their innovative products. Good luck ‘BoAt’ and wish you happy sailing! :)"

Some I used for myself some I gifted to family members. But we are a Boat family now.Ita worth buying. Best sound quality. Just sometimes person on the other side hears less voice of yours during call using microphone. Elee it's great all time. Would recommend you to go for it.

If you are having a confusion of ear hooks ,then it might can trouble you for 1 day only after that you will use to it .

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),East to West Wired Headphone is best,4.0,I have another two Bluetooth headphone and using since last two years. But after using so many headphone I realized that Wired headphone is best headphone even now also.Pros1. No need to charge it2. Sound quality is good3. Can adjust volume from dedicated button4. Mute and call receive/end can be done through dedicated button5. Wired quality is good.Cons1. Always there are some wired hanging on you.2. Some times its giving pain to ear.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Too Good and Too Bad,3.0,"I ordered these earphones after using boAt bassheads 225 and have been using these earphones since two months and i thought i should write a reviewFirst time when i ordered (2 pairs, one for me and the other for my brother) , BOTH WERE DEFECTIVE ! Ordered again with a successful refund and using them since till datePros:--Very good sound quality-Very comfortable on ears and you can use them as long as you want without pain in the ears-Extreme bass , bass lovers like me would love this-Very good noise cancellationCons:--These earphones get tangled very easily and the anti-tangle claim is false-It is very likely that you would get a defective product so check for it . My one of the earphones had no sound on the left earplug and the second earphones had inverted right and left. Check for all these defects as soon as you get these earphones-the pin is straight unlike the 225 so the wire gets turned at a 90 degree angle which can result in breakning of the wire in the long runConclusion- Sound quality is really great and these earphones are really comfortable , you might get defective piece so check for that. Its a great deal although there's just a feeling i get that these earphones are not good for the longer run. Would update ya'll if they stop working."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst Microphone although sound quality is fine,2.0,"Guys the microphone absolutely sucks! You cannot talk on a call properly with this one because the call receiver cannot hear you at all!The sound quality is good, but a earphone is not only for that right? Its all a hands-free product for your calls! Bad experience for me"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Satisfied, good performance,  noise cancellation good, worth buying again.",5.0,"Good earphones and worth purchasing a second one. The earphone wire quality is also fine and there is no problem, of any sort since beginning.Noise cancellation is also satisfactory however,  in this time of lockdown since unable to move out in open so cannot test it on moving ground. But when there is lots of noise of other equipment at home then these  headphones cancel noise satisfactorily."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst customer service,1.0,"It says it is designed for fitness enthusiasts and water resistant but I feel it's just a marketing strategy.I used it only ones while running and the next moment it stopped working.Worst part is the customer service. I went to Borivali center with the product, forget about the solution they didn't even register my complaint. They asked me to come back whenever the product is available. And its been months now they don't have product available and the solution according to them is to visit another service center which is in very far from my place.In short it's customer who have to suffer for the worst customer service and for buying such disgusting Brand product."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Good speakers and mic, handy, long lasting",5.0,"You must try. So the packing and delivery was good . Other then this the product is awesome as per budget . I bought one earphone with gurantee but the wire torned and automatically seprated from the buds . And only 2 months I think I have used that and the cost was 300. Then I bought this and either it's not long time but it's very handy, soft wire, good sound and speakers hold and mic is also good . I am not very Cary for earphones and also I bought this kind of buds first time and I am completely satisfied ."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),I felts its not a great buy,3.0,"I didnt personally like it sound quality, mids and lows and even bass is very much average. Tried it for music, movies but not satisfactory on pubg the performace is way too bad as the noise is too high. I was using an mi headphones and they where far better than these. Not at all good for long users...  This is my realistic review after about 2 months of usage"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Excellent sound... Great value for money...,5.0,"After years of using earphones from other brands (which always costed me more), I came across and bought this pair from boat. Special thanks to Amazon for quick delivery.I got the earphones for INR 499, and am quite pleasantly surprised and delighted by the set of features these earphones offer. You get excellent bass and sound quality (better than other brands in my experience in this price range), volume control buttons (which I didn't expect at this price :)), play-pause-call button, a clip to ease the hands-free experience, durable and thicker wires, and sturdy earphone casing. This seems to be specially designed to withstand wear and tear during regular usage. The buds also have small and comfortable hook shaped grips that firmly keep the buds in place when you are running. It also comes with a small pouch to help you carry them easily. So much at this price, it's really an excellent product at this price that offers good perks along with a great sound quality."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Perfect but not durable,5.0,After use of 1 month....-Initially the sound is soooo amazing... You gonna love the earphones but after use of few days bass starts fading (don't know the appropriate word)- starting few days it gives you clear sound with clear bass but after a month or 2 months... It start giving you noisy sound.How i compare?I bought 2 products 1 from Amazon and 1 from boat website and after a month i open the brand new package i ordered from boat and anyone can feel the difference.So this product is good but not durable.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good for the price but could be better quality wise .,4.0,Good but feels kind of cheap since my previous earphones were the Sennheiser cx275s. It's been 2 weeks and I  was cleaning the mesh in the earphones and it just got pushed in . I didn't even put  pressure on it . Small things like this really ruin the experience. I found the ear tips provided in the box to be of a cheaper quality and I found that changing them with the silicone ear tips of the Sennheiser cx275s helped make my experience better .
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Best Product. Durable, HQ Sound and good noise cancellation.",5.0,"Very good product. Been using it since 6-7 months continuously. Very rough usage (while traveling in Mumbai local). Still its very durable, sound quality is not compromised at all. In 80% volume you won't feel any sound from outside. The rubber whites might be irritating to some but its easily detachable. Very good product in this price range."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Strictly average!,4.0,"Bought these earphones after reading all these positive reviews here.  So here's my review:Box contains the earphones, two extra rubber buds, a pouch to carry the earphones, a warranty card, a pamplet showing other boat products and a boat sticker.Coming to earphones itself, the build seems good enough, nothing extra ordinary. The wire from the separtor till the earpieces seems a bit thin. The wires are covered in a nylon outer which gives it a cheap look if I'm being honest.The earphones fit firmly but one might find some discomfort at first because of that rubber horn for sports activities. Wearing and removing the earphones with them is difficult as well. Though it is removable but the earphones look bad without them.Coming to the sound quality, this is where I got a little disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much but I didn't like the sound output much. The bass is too much boosted that it just kills the other aspects of the song. The treble sounds below average because of the overpowered bass. If you want a overall balanced sound experience then please go with some other earphones. I was using JBL C150si before this and those JBLs are way superior in terms of sound experience."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Read review before buying,5.0,Read before you buy.....This earphone is really awesomeGot it on lighting deal I have used both boat bassheads 200 and boat bassheads 242 comparnid both earphones in my personal view I personally like the bassheads 242  It's worth every pennyCause  The bass in comparison is better in242  If you are not a bass lover don't go for  thiss earphones  The hook is really usefull while moving  causee it doesn't fall off from your ears  But the hooks may caue slight discomfortPros:-  Light weight  Doesn't easily fall off from your ears  Bass quality is really good  The mids and highs are optimised  Braided cable is really usefull  Tangle free cablesCons:-  Ear hooks may cause slight discomfort  in some peoples  Heavy bass may cause ear pain(  hey  then why do you call it bass heads)Truly Value for money
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),I will recommend to have it,5.0,"Best sound qualityExcellent looksEasy 2 useNever sweats while using for long timeBest in priceBeautiful pack from boat company that includes one clip, ear buds and small pouch to carry anywhere.Also recommend to have dime earbuds from 💀 skullcandy.Enjoy it."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Unnecessary Extra bass..,3.0,"This Earphones is only good for EDM, DUBSTEP and Beat lovers.. very less Clarity, Extra Bass Which makes the voicing muffled. I'd recommend you all to use the equaliser to balance the bass.  Look wise is good. Not for rock, metal music lover . . And Most importantly You can't use it for long use.. ears starts hurting after 15-20 mins of use.. I Guess it's because of That extra bass..After a week of use you ears will start hurting a lil bit..Over all OKAY experience..Sound - 3Clarity - 2Look-  4Noise Cancellation - 4Quality - 3.5"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money,5.0,So I'll be sharing my views about this earphone with you guys. So I'll be summing up my review in total of 3 points i.e. experience ‚ comparison and why you should buy it1) Experience : If I talk about my experience then I'll say that I have been using these boat earphones for 4 months and I haven't faced any issue yet ☺️ .  As the name itself suggests BASSheads they truly offers a very good bass . The mids and lows are also good. They are truly value for money.2) Comparison : As it's price is around 550 I don't think any other big brand provides any earphones in this price segment but if your budget is around 700 then definitely go for the jbl ones3)Why should you buy it : According to me around at a price of 550 they are definitely one of the finest earphones . But one of the major reason why I brought these earphones is because of boAt not just because its a big brand but also of its warranty i.e. boAt provides doorstep return pickup of your earphones in ODISHA I don't know about any other state  So I would say if warranty matters to you a lot then these boAt earphones are definitely for you .Pros1) Braided cable you don't have to worry about your cable anymore like I do 😅2) boAt offers wings which will never let the earphones come out if your ears 😋.3)Stylish and premium looking 😎.4) ipx4 water resistant 😃.5)You can use these earphones while lying on your bed or lounge these won't hurt 😉.Cons1) The earbuds are not metal but plastic 😔Hope my review will help you choose your earphones :-)EDIT after 10 months of usage *slight issues in the left earbuds* will try to claim its warranty lets see
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Don't buy this product worst purchase ever,1.0,worst experience with the boat this time. I have already used many boat products but this time the earphones are worst of their sound as well as the microphone is even worst. First i thought that it is the network problem. After that everyone is saying same that my voice is cracking and they are hearing the voice like the robot is speaking. I also replaced the product. I thought this was the issue with this product only but the second one is also the same. I don't recommend this product of boat. Instead you can use bassheads 152 that is a good one.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Stopped working in 75 Days (Born - 28th Oct 2021 , Died - 16th Jan 2022)",1.0,Sound quality and bass was ok (below average) but it was working for 2 months. Then one side of the ear phone stopped working and died completely today(after 75 days from purchase). Shouldn't have gone for this cheap one. Recommendation - DON'T BUY
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not built to last,1.0,"Though the sound quality is good, the product is delicate and not built to last.The ear plugs are very soft at the base where it attaches to the earphones and easily comes off by itself if you pull it out of the pocket or a bag.There is no support to the wire where it attaches to the 3.5mm jack. After just one month of use the wire broke from the jack.Over all rating is 1 star as it is useless just after 1 month.My suggestion: Buy one with 'L' shaped jack, they last a lot longer."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"If You're a Gamer, These aren't for you.",2.0,My Review about this earphone :1. Build Quality : 4/5 for its material and snug fitting in the ears and also for the anti tangled wire2. Sound Quality :  Base : 4/5  Voice calling : 3/5  Volume : 3/5 it can make u deaf easily on high volume ( recommend not more than 70% for music)  Noice Cancellation : 5/5 ( suppress external sound upto 90%)  For Gaming(especially BGMI) : 1/5 (not recommended for Gaming. As u can hear nearby sound so hard that you're unable to hear footsteps properly from a certain distance.3. Value for Money : 3/5  For Music : Hell Yeah  For Gaming : Not recommended.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Overall, a good package.",4.0,"I received the package today. Tried it right away. Here are the things I noticed:-1. Sound quality- bang for the buck2. Bass quality- I'm not much of a basshead but I can say it's really nice.3. Build quality- honestly the last boat earphones I had felt much more of higher build quality,but still they ended up dead in one side after few months of usage. This one is glossy and not much to my liking but does not feel that much cheap too. Cables are braided, the right nd left cable feels braided but is not.4. In the box- I got a pouch, extra tips, a clip to attach the cords.5. Overall experience- good. I'm happy for now. Sound is nice and clear just how I like it. Still I have not tested it with all kinds of music but it gets the job done pretty nicely. Looks are really nice. Best part is the fitting in ear. I had never seen an earphone fit in my ear so nicely without falling out.Will update more after using it for a while."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),BASS earphone suits for gaming  but miss very little features,4.0,"the material quality of the headphone is good one . the MIC works well . And this headphone is best suits to the people who loves bass music . and it is good for gaming too. but the audio quality is quite depressing . very different experience from the ear phone I used before .This is the. Review what Iam writing after four months ( below) .The left side of the earphone stops working  , I don't know why . So if you are using this earphone . Handle with care  , it might stop working one day ."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Great for the price, but far from perfect",4.0,"I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars. I'm giving it 4 because it's the best in its range i'd say.But there are downsides, the treble is very weak and the bass is overshadowing everything else. It doesn't produce the clearest of sounds because of this. The ear hooks are very uncomfortable after an hour of use.Buy this if you're on a tight budget, I'd suggest spending 200-300 more and get Sony MDR or Sennheiser CX 180.I wished boat balanced out everything for a better experience rather than going all out on bass. Not the best for pure listening experience because of weak trebles etc."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Conclusion:-,3.0,"If you are buying it for listening to music and you are on a tight budget then you are good to go. But the Mic is absolutely awful. There is no concept called 'Noise Cancellation', the mic itself creates noise. But the 'Bass' is quite good. But the 3D sound effect is not good. The wire's build quality is good but the earphones seems quite cheap. Personally after using it for music and gaming, I will not recommend you to buy this for playing mobile games. But for casual purposes it's reliable."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Buy without any discussion,5.0,"Boat's ear cord is always been trademark among other earphones. There is no issue in the sound quality, bass quality but little expensive to this price. If we juxtapose this one with other, definitely, we can get that, this earphone much better experience than others.Dont be late, go ahead and keep this beautiful earphone in your pocket.Thank you."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Using so far good,4.0,"Used for few days now it comes with a pouch ,1 yr warranty card,ear buds extra with the headset and a menu card of boat products.Bass is nice,so far good sound quality,flexible wires too,comfortable on ears as there's support.I took lime green colour.You can take any colour.Longetivity of speakers can be only told after some months of use.so far nt bad.Wire is long if straight look its like from head to below waist the length is gud."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),For Beginners it's good.,2.0,"In my opinion, I don't find these earphones that good. For beginners, they can go for it but users like me who use to spend plenty of time listening to music, communicating on discord and gaming. It is not suitable.  After some point, they feel like they stucked in your ear, pain in earlobes and high pitch sound hits like an arrow.Mic input is ok, you get clear sound in quite environment but if you are in noisy environment, they capture all those noise."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Awesome sound,4.0,"I have been using mi earphones from past 2 years and they are surprisingly quite durable and lasting but they didn’t sound so good. So i went for boats this time as i already have boat rockerz 400 and boat is getting more and more better in quality and sound. so its been quite a good time i have been using this and they are pretty good. This are awesome they dont fall out of your ear due to the silicon attachment with it. As it name says bass heads they are actually good with it bass. The audio is crisp and perfect, i would recommend them over bassheads 225. Overall quality is nice and perfect at this price point. If you are looking to get a good pair then give this a shot. You wont regret it"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Do not go for TWS from Boat, instead purchase this at a lower price",4.0,Do not go for TWS from Boat as they have very less durability and life time. I've bought many tws from Boat and within a year or two all are malfunctioning. Instead this wired earphone is more practical and can last upto same 2 years meanwhile offering better audio quality at a lesser price which will give you lesser depreciation after two years. Mic and audio quality is decent for a regular guy to handle calls and listen to music or stream online content. Good fit with very minimal noise cancellation(I'm ok with it).Best wired earphones in this price range.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Less quality,2.0,"Not worth, sound quality. its cheap Chinese quality sound. Its make crackling sound some because its Chinese quality. For bass use inbuilt or extra equilizer.who has a 10 t0 15 years continuous headset listening experience definitely don't like its sound quality. Just pay for design. Also seller not sent with good packaging. Going to return."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not satisfied,3.0,"I've been using branded Earphones since year 2000.I used many brands , Sony , Nokia , SoundCore , Samsung , Jabra and many others.I'm not comparing it with premium brands.But according to price , here is what I think.Let's talk about sound quality.Sounds aren't soft i feel this earphones will give you headache if you listen to it for 30 minutes.Instruments sounds aren't clear , and I'm not able to hear many instruments in this earphone.Over-all Sounds feels like very flat , and sounds of this earphones irritates me.Bass is fine fine ( acceptable at this price)But except bass other sounds are very flat.If you need one year warranty and need good call quality then you can go for this one.But if you're looking for better sound quality then this earphone isn't for you.I have tried BoAt products , and i feel BoAt is all about advertisements and show off, actual products are cheap and not worth the amount they're taking.This earphones sounds same as cheap earphones you can buy from local market under 200rs.I don't feel anything special about BoAt ,And this is last product i purchased from BoAt , in future, i won't even think that this brand even Exists.I'm not a hater , but I'm not satisfied as a consumer.And it's my right to give review or feedback to help others.It was my honest review.Thanks"

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst sound quality ever with 0 bass and pain in the ears,1.0,This is the worst product ever . The sound quality is worst with high tribble and no bass . I tried it in different devices but the sound qualty is extreme poor. I returned the product and purchased a MI Rs 300 head phone which gabe me high qualty as compaired with this Rs500 one. The sound quality will make you impossible to hear in full sound .Never recommend this product to any one .You will have to visit the doctor if you use it .Worst product ever in terms of quality .Please do not buy this product .
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best for bassheads In this price range,3.0,"If had to give a review of this product in one line that would be ""pure bliss for bassheads""And if for the detailed review let's starts with the packagingIt's simple clean and clearYou'll get 2 extra pair of eartips, 1 carrying pouch, earphone and booklet and a warrenty card.Now the build qualityIn the price range of 550 rs the build quality is good, the wire is sturdy.The housing is made out of plastic though it doesn't look or feel cheap.You get 3 buttons for call and volume up down, which is really rare in this price range.Next and most important is soundIt's a really a joy to listen edms and party mixes. You get that thumping vibrating bass.Trebles I'll say goodMids are lost in effect to create the bass, youLosse the details.Vocals are clear.The earphones are loud enough to enjoy songs in 70% volume level.So to summarise I'll say if you want details clear crisp sound then you have to up your budget a little bit and go for some other brands like sony or maybe jbl.And if you need the thumping base, you need  a earphone for pubg then just close your eyes and press the buy button.For the price of 449-550 it's a steal deal."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Extreme great experience.,5.0,Received within 24 hours. Had a great experience from the product. Very good product within the price range. The audio was excellent. Recommend to buy 😎. I got the product in offer for 399 . Original price was 1490/- almost 70 percent off 😁😁😁😁😁. Thank you Amazon for the great product with good offer.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It met with my expectations,4.0,"As expected from boat, the sound was pretty good, the bass and treble balance was decent and also it was pretty comfortable to wear. It's better than 225 model because they were little bit heavy. The buttons helped me a lot whenever I wanted to change songs but didn't wanted to turn on my screen in the middle of night. A 4 star from me cause, if it had braided cables or maybe flat type cables I would definitely give it a 5 stars."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Build quality is poor and wires are fragile,3.0,Ordered after reading that wires are strong. They are neither braided as shown in picture  or pull resistant as claimed. And I don’t have an option to return! This is clear cheating both from Boat and Amazon
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),DON'T Buy this product,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Bought this in April 2021 to try new product which has a good bass. Initially it was working good. But after 4 months which the products is not used much, on the right side volume of the headphone volume is very less. Tried to claim the warranty but the service centre is 2 hour away from my place. Would recommend to go for other brand or Philips is the one I am using it works for 2 years easily. Earlier I had bought boat earphones after one year onside of the earphone stopped working which I had used a lot in mumbai local. In short I feel it's not a good product don't waste your money."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Amazing,5.0,Really loved the product right from out of the delivery cover😅 packing of boat was always unique and stylish when got into it it was really surprising as i was just expecting earphones with spare of earbuds but this company really is a standout from all of the brands it even gave a small pouch for earphones and a branding sticker. Which kept more than satisfied for the price range of 449. When all of other brands are concentrating on just package this stoodout by thinking from customer point of view what exactly will be useful.After plugging the jack my 1st expression was 😳😲😯 wooow just woow nothing else. 😄😄
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Honest review after 3 months of usage.,5.0,"I've been using these earphones for 3 months now and so far there were no issues at all. They fit really well in the ears thus making it perfect for sports. The audio is very clear and the bass quality is amazing. I wouldn't say these earphones are noise cancelling but yes it does control the noise around to some extent. The mic quality is excellent. One more thing I liked about these earphones was that you get a small earphone case in the box. You also get some pictures of your favourite celebrities. Also, I was surprised to see that these budget earphones have volume control buttons! If you were to ask me I would definitely recommend this product. Amazing for the price(549/-)."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best quality earphones in just <500 Rs is just a blessing !!!,5.0,"I was eagerly searching for a good earphones having vest of sound, base, durability, looks, good calling voice, etc...All of these but just below Rs 500...Now I just couldn't stop admiring Boat Company. I really loved how in such a good price you provide the best of your products. Thnx a lot. I recommend theses earphones to all the music lovers but not extravagant earphones buyers. This product is definitely for you. Amazing sound and good base. I love listening to metallic music amd for that these earphones are really amazing. Although I didn't like the rest of the colours other than black, I appreciate if they would've provided some other deep dark shades like blue, purple, mahroom etc. These colours are dominating. So I bought black."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Amazing Earphones,5.0,"I was about to buy some other earphones from another company that are much expensive than this, but at the last moment I got to know about this earphone, and I now I am happy that I waited 5 minutes more to order, otherwise a nice product would have missed.Sound Quality: 9/10 (depends upon individuals music and sound preference)Product Quality: 9/10 (cable and mic quality Is amazing)Fitting: 10/10(I used boat earphones earlier, this plastic support were pathetic, but in this it's amazing)Noise Cancellation: 9/10(only when something is playing, active noise cancellation is not present here)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Great product with a big quirk,4.0,"I found the sound and especially the bass to be great. Lived upto its claim of a ""bassHead"". Sound 5. What I found bad, is the earhook gives a stinging pain in the outer ear and its really annoying. Its not something I could bear, that annoying. With that said, maybe I got used to it a bit (considering I was using over-the-ear headphones for a long while and rarely used in-ear ) and I also switched the small ear-tip to the fat-tip that they provide, and I can almost give it a 4 star review. really if sound is all you care about, get the basshead 220 or something. But the product looks good, sounds great, even for gaming I cant complain, and is uncomfortable if you are not suited to in-ear styled earphones. Feels sturdy too, hopefully lasts a good while. overall a 4 star, not bad."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Decent Quality.,4.0,Pros : Build Quality [not braided but has a protective layer on wires].  Aesthetically Nice.  Quite a good fitting. Fits really well. Do not tend to fall off.  Has a clip to hold the wires together.Cons : Bass on a lower side (may not be good for bass lovers) yet decent.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Loud! Half the volume is enough. Super bass and comfort,5.0,"All pros..The only earphones that actually remained in my ear..Good bass.Volume is so ooud, I had to reduce my phone volume to half, whereas previous ones, even Mi had to be put at full volume.I bought it after reading the great reviews.Really worth the money, they also give ear plugs of different sizes"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It's only to brag. Not the best in class.,4.0,"Here is my experience with the eaphones1. Unboxing : Here it is a bit of cost cutting. The box is not of great quality and the your unboxing experience is not that great2. Build quality : The earphones are well built. We get the three buttons under 500. Definitely will last for 1 year + under moderate care. Wires are also of great quality although they are not braided.3. Sound quality : No compromise here. It's really great. Probably the best sounding experience under 500.4. Others : I am being very blunt. The eartips are very bad. Although they will get your job done. But compare it with the likes of mi and realme. They have way better eartips and it is something you will noticeThe earhooks seemed to me more annoying than useful. We can remove them so it's nothing to worry about.You also get a pouch. It really isn't that great. Like if they were giving they could have given a proper one where earphones could easily be placed.Overall if you could manage to get 100 more, then go for realme buds 2. I have those too and you will not regret."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Sound is jittery at higher volumes,1.0,This is a repeat purchase for me. First one is still working very well even today. But this new one's sound is jittery at higher volumes. I bought multiple boAt products but this is the first one which is defective. Didn't expect from boAt. Unfortunately my return window lapsed by four days due to my travel.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),At this price range this earphone is perfect.♥️,5.0,"Basshead 242 I love this product, also I love to use boAt's products & I used 7or8 product. cause all those good products which I am use really nice & great. And boAt give their all customers the best quality in minimum price range.In this earphone the sound quality is pretty good.Bass is perfect for my opinion, volume up and down bottom & call receiving button is perfectly handy, 3.5 mm jack is not gold-plated but also the Jack is working very nicely.♥️"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Quality boat product,4.0,"It has been only 10 days since my purchase. It is too early to give a detailed review. Since my purchase I have used the earphone with my POCO mobile to watch videos and to listen songs. I will rate the audio quality to be GOOD among the mid range earphones. I have also used with my Dell laptop, to play strategy games like Northgard, Dota2. These games usually take 2-3 hours straight. I didn't feel anything uncomfortable during long sessions, as I have read from other reviews (may be it is just my personal feelings). But I feel that the earphone jack doesn't fit my laptop socket and so it reduces the audio quality a bit."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Satisfied, changed my notion of Boat.",5.0,"Using it for 8 months now. I have never expected a company like Boat and that too a relatively cheap product in their ouvre, would survive my usage for that long.Sound is really good compared to ubon or other brands in this range. Boat had a diluted JBL sound, at least that's what I inferred when I used their first product, but this headphone has a sound akin to Sony and I like it. (I personally prefer Sony, Sennheiser over JBL, for their  warmer and more fulsome sound).Also the piping they did with the wire is the icing, and I believe that single handedly stretched it's longetivity.Very happy with what I got, Boat has earned my trust truly. They improved."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Value for money, good earphones overall",5.0,"Earphones sound good with some emphasis on bass but it's not overpowering. They're lightweight and cable quality is nice.If you crank up your Equalizer and boost the bass, the earphones literally start vibrating on high volumes. The best part is there's no distortion whatsoever, good earphones by boat 👌. They sound much better than my previous mi basic.Only con is on using the earphones for 2+ hours, ears start hurting a bit.It also comes with a clip so that you can wear these to your workouts.Offers a lot for ~500₹ range, can't go wrong with this purchase.Pros-LightweightCan handle strong bassSort of braided cableWing tipsGood sound qualityValue for money ✔️Cons-Maybe cut down on the packaging, lot of paper and plastic wasted"

(If you want go with Basshead 225)Wire Quality Great.Free Cloth Pouch in the box.Pouch is not suitable for Earphone. But you can store old-valuable coins or pendrive, card reader etc.Boat After Service Experience is Awesome.So I am happy with all boat products."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Honest review. Don't buy these.,1.0,"Bought these a month and 12 days ago.. as a regular user of earphones, headphones and Bluetooth devices.  These earphones are a disappointment.  After spending money on this I can officially say worst purchase ever.- Left earphones works fine, but right won't function.- The call button automatically calls, plays music, does any random thing.-  with an amazing past experience with this company I'm 100% convinced that they need to work on quality, after sales services and replacement.- I live far from service center almost 30kms but they want me to come down there and get it checked for replacement? How is it fair and reasonable?Sounds quality in first week was so awesome it started hurting my ears. Even while ridding you can hear other vehicles at distance of 6-12ft at full volume.**Update**Now the call, volume button has stopped working permanently and it's now useless. worth buy ever."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good product.,4.0,"Ok it's descent product. Build quality is good.Sound quality is good for bass lovers. But bass reduces the other small sound effects, but it's ok for regular use. If you are a pro music listener who need every small detail of instruments played then go for some other costly products."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Poor Build Quality,3.0,"This was my 2nd purchase for this headphones. Initially I bought spirit lime color. That was worth for money. Build Quality was solid & sturdy. It lasted for more than 18 months even after rough use.2nd time I bought the same piece in Neon Green color, but wire quality was compromised. The rubber coating of the wire expanded & wire got spiraled & crumpled within 5 months of use. Also one thing I noticed that coating of wires were completely different.There might be 2 possibilities: 1. Different colored Headphones have different quality. 2. This time the product was NOT genuine as my 1st purchase was from different website."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Buttons in it aren't working,4.0,"I received the bass heads earphone three days back. And using them for three days for about 3-4 hours in a day, here is my review of the product.Pros: 1: It's bass and treble combination is awesome. It make you hear the sounds which you don't hear without earphones.2: It's loudness is amazing, on full volume, you can't hear what the other person is saying. You don't hear the outside noises.3: It fits perfectly into the ears, much to my surprise. As I thought that it would hurt after some time, but it doesn't. They ear heads are made of rubber and are super comfotable.Cons:It's volume and call button isn't working at all.If the buttons could work, it is a super good piece for music 🎵 lovers.That's all."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Must Buy!,5.0,"First of all the very important point is build quality, it will not go anywhere no matter how roughly u use it.Sound quality is excellent you can't listen to it on full volume although its clear enough.Comfortable - no need to adjust again and again.Bass should be become lil better but still you can't take is as con.Pouch and extra buds are useful and awesome.Surely go for it"

The drivers are very capable. It comes with a good amount of accessories for this price range. Sound quality is just fine!

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Great for the price,5.0,"Best earphones for the price. Build quality is great, sound and noise cancellation is also very, very good. Bass comes out nice and crisp. Loud as well. I personally don't like loud music, I enjoy at medium volume levels so it is best for me. Also it has a quite snug fit in the ears so it won't fall off while jogging/workout sessions. Also you get a cute pouch with it. Will update on long term use later."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Sound is good, quality is not..",3.0,"ProsSound quality is one of the best in the price range.The bass is not that high, so its good if you prefer vocals more.It has full 3 button control instead of the one button which makes it easier for music controlConsThe wire is WEAK. It broke in a few monthsIt has no flat  or braided cable instead a thin plastic one.( it gets tangled always)The earbuds are of bad quality. The buds hole is wider which makes sound better but the quality of the bud is not good infact its worse than any boat earphone.It doesn't have L shaped or angled jack which i don't prefer."

The unit is original and I've raised a complaint ticket. I didn't expect this from a brand like BoAt, I don't find this product to be reliable.Edit - only a few months later, the replaced unit also stopped working I'm really frustrated with these earphones."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Average product but can get better product at same price,3.0,I am typing this review after 2 weeks I had used this product and my personal experience was it's not comfortable to wear after one hour. Sound quality is sharp and good but I notice it get reduce after one week of usage product packaging and build is quite attractive and its water resistant and good for daily use.Conclusion : i will say please don't go for this earphone they are good but you can get better ear phones and some point this ear phone design is annoying and it's not comfortable to wear after certain time you will get this point when you use this ear phone for after that its start irritating and itching in ears I will suggest you better go for different option 😉
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not recommended for purchase.,1.0,"You will get ear pain for the continuous use of 10 to 15 minutes.Initially I tried the basic version of boat ear phone and started getting ear pain, I thought it might be one of the defect piece, therefore I tried the advanced version next time and experiencing the same ear pain. Not recommended for long time use."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Crisp, Loud, Clear, Heavy Bass",5.0,"This is my 1st Boat product. My mother uses Airdopes which has amazing sound and tonality. These headphones however come affordable with an awesome design and futuristic look with dynamic sound, bass and beats which crisp vocals..really awesome for someone who likes and enjoys Rock, Metal, Blues."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money product. Best quality. Very comfortable. Best audio,5.0,"Value for money product.Sound quality superb at this priceNoise cancellation is pretty good tooBass quality is one of the best in this price rangeIt is very comfortable when listening music, watching movies/series and also for calling.The positioning of mic is too good,very near to mouth so no issue in mic as well.I personally used this earphones for straight 3-4 hrs without any issue..So I'll give 9.5/10..Definitely a must buy product...I'll recommend it to anyone for 500 or 550 rs... Its worth the money.Adding this part after 17 days of usage.The earphones are really superb. Bass is also awesome and treble and vocals are much better than other earphones at this price range.Only thing a lot of people are complaining about is the ear hooks that starts paining aftet sometime. Well it did happen to me but I figured out that I was putting the hook in a wrong way which was causing pain. But after I corrected the way I can wear it for hours and take calls and watch movies web series easily..And also the carry pouch that is supplied in the box is too handy to carry earphones to avoid any damage and it looks really dope as well.A must buy product if you are looking for earphone at budget of 500."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Budget earphones with average sound quality and average build quality,5.0,"The product meets basic standard for the price, build quality isn't great, lost audio on one side after 3 months, pleasantly the replacement processing was simple and fast, I got a new one in a weeks time. The second one worked for next 7 months and one head opened up with loose soldering. So in effect including one replacement lasted for a year, sound quality was fairly consistent until the last month of failure.For the price and for general rough usage  it's decent enough."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Okish but not that good for hearing music 😕,3.0,So I have been using this earphones for like 5 months now so I can say that this earphone is basic good value for money but for the ones who are primarily going to use it music have to stop even I thought this would be very nice after moving from jbl earphones which is gem for hearing music but not this one so if ur primary goal music then I'd say buy the jbl ones much better bass and very good for music and u just want for meeting and other simple works then this is ok and it doesn't last very long if ur a gamer because mine has louse contact issue in just some months this is surely bad😔
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money earphones,4.0,Best in class... I can't believe boat has made such a good sounding earphone at this price point. It in itself justifies the price..... I own a senhheiser cx 180 so I know what a premium earphone sounds like.It sounds almost like a premium earphone and the sound signature is balanced not too bassy and mids and highs were clear... Wire quality is soft to touch and feels durable but have to see how long it lasts both (externally and internally)....the connector is not L-shalped so it looks like the wire may get damaged at the joint.Also it doesn't tangle in my everyday use. Overall value for money
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Expected Better Quality,3.0,"**Writing a review after using it for 6 + months**1. Sound Quality - 3/52. Durability (daily use - left earbud stopped working after 6 - 7 months) - 2/53. Mediocre noise isolation - 2/54. Bass Quality - 3/5Overall, if you have heavy use of earphones like me, then this product in my view is not recommended"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Nice purchase at reasonable cost,4.0,Earphones are great in look and feel. It takes some time to adjust so might hurt few days when using continously for long time but later it will become fine. That extra pouch along with earphones is great. All round nice product at very reasonable price only issue is wire is very thin and so need to be very careful.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Review after a abusive relationship with the earphones mostly me,5.0,I have been using this to mainly play COD in mobile1.The foot steps can be heard better than players around you so it works like a charm in finding those sneaking behind you or coming towards your in close range2.You can never wear it the wrong way due the ear lobes supporter or whatever they are called.3. I have slept over it and it doesn't break unless you're sleeping on a rock by time traveling to stone age.4. Earlobes will pain if the supports are not worn in a right way5. The extra clip provided to clip on to your shirts works well helpful to keep the microphone right in its audio signal pickup range thus providing consistent audio output to listener unless you're networks isnt goodFinally for better audio output do not use the ear buds that are provided as they aren't the best so if you have a friend having spare ear buds of  Sony MDR-XB55 Extra-Bass( pro tip: Ya you can fake your friendship for a while like everyone these days untill you get those spare buds  ) these ones they sit flushly in your ears there by creating its own seal thus reducing sound entering your ear from outside and creating a sense of artificial depth and clarity which the original OEM earbuds lack as they feel flimsy
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Boat is boss!!!,5.0,"Nice bass frequency.all music trac audioble.3d surround affect osm.connecting wiresFlexible, no sunce of year.extra length andBuds are soft.i also buy boat rokerz blue tooth over the ear headset and this one also provide me total setisfaction.thanks boat for quality controll."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not so water resistant,3.0,It's been few weeks and volume buttons are acting up! Probably because of the sweat due to workout. I bought this hoping that button won't stop working by catching some sweat but it was a big let down. I have ruined many earbuds while working out and this one didn't turn out to be any different. What a disappointment. Good sound tho!!
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),great bass and loudness,4.0,its have nice sound but what I experienced in boat 225 was much better even built quality was better of boat 225 but boat 242 is more attractive and it also give nice sound .its sound loudness is muh far better then its other competitors rven I tried SoundCloud q10 and claw g11 but both sound was little low as compare to this earphone butits cons is that it have loud sound which sometimes mis with other sound and create little difficulty in identifying different sound...I am using it for pubg .....and really enjoying it
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best earphones for Bass in this price.,4.0,Sound quality is decent. Bass is very rich. Noise cancellation is sub-par. It comes with some extra pair of buds. Finishing is perfect and colour combination makes it even more attractive.I feel the wiring is a little fragile and might not be suitable while running or walking or some other kind of movement.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Slightly Dissapointed/ Update: never buying Boat again,1.0,Have been using this for 2 months now. The audio is quality is good. The Ear wings are very discomforting after extended use so i have removed them completely.Two Main problem areas for me are:1: The mike has to be held very close to the mouth as the other person always complains that its not audible. ( I Don't face this issue with other wired/bluetooth headphones i have)2: The link of the earpiece head and base has become loose all of a sudden and it comes off and all the wires are exposed. Even removing the ear piece lightly after use separates the assembly.Going for a warranty claim. Will update the ratings and reviews after the warranty process.**********Update:  the earpiece loose casing caused the wires inside to break. TERRIBLE AFTER SALES SERVICE.claiming  warranty on website redirects you to their closest service centers.*****On first visit the service center was closed despite working hours.On second they said they have closed office for Boat and no longer work with boat.Called on call center and it keeps you on waiting to connect with representative but never gets connected.EXTREMELY disappointing.  I have already wasted 200rs worth of fuel to visit service center for 500rs worth of earphones. NEVER BUYING AGAIN.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Affordable durable and Best sound quality.,5.0,"Bass is good and the sound quality, pitch and noise cancellation is also good.Pros:-1) Suitable when using in workouts, and running.2) Fits in ear without slipping.3) Wire is tangle free.4) supper Affordable in this price range. under 6005) Better then ang other realme sur senheisher earphones.6) Light and sturdy7) Earphone jack is made of metalCons-:1) Ear hooks can cause irritation in ears if you wear for long time and very regularly, in my case I felt uncomfortable after 50 hours of use.(don't worry about the ear hooks , they are detachable)2) Plastic earphones, not even single part made of metal.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PERFORMANCE OVER LOOKS GO FOR BOAT BASSHEADS. 172.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Product doesn't suit its definition,2.0,Writing this review afrer initial use for few hours.1. I wanted to return the product as it hurts my ears (tried all the possible adjustments but it still would hurt) but Amzon wants to replace the same product and I don't see any point in that as the design itself is a challenge (may be only for me)2. The sound quality is fine however bass is not as the company advertises. My old JBL (C110) priced at 649/- as of now vs 499/- for this product is many times better (tested at the same song at the same volume and felt the difference).
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Quality is great but soumd is not that good.,3.0,"wire quality is excellent, mic is good, having pouch to carry earphones is best... But not that good in terms of fit not that good and one more thing.. We buy earphones to feel music, sound quality, clarity is average.. Words are not clear. If u r a true music lover than go for JBL C-100❤️ best earphone under 1k, no match of that earphone in terms of sound quality.. Even I brought that JBL C-100 three times, thebedt earphone.. This Boat is also not bad but jbl is 🧡"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not bad not good,3.0,So I bought this product and it was working fine. But after just 1 week it started having problems. Whenever I plug in my headphones it would have that zzzzzzzz sound we all get from televisions. And then I would have to remove it and plug it in again in a different position to get it working properly.The reason I still rated this 3 stars is because WHEN it is working it is awesome. The sound quality is amazing and the bass is also top class.And if any of you are wondering why I didnt replace a defective product is because I noticed the problem after the replacement time period had expired. So couldn't do anything.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),A beautiful In ear headphone worth the price!!,5.0,"First of all, the product was same as shown in the pictures! (Both material wise & quality wise!)The hooks can be detach from it, so u can use it as your wish and comfortable!! Then comes to the features like sound controls ,is good! & also in quality wise too, it's  too good for both sound & bass!  In terms of rating, I will give 5 stars for both sound and bass and comes to noise cancellation, will give 4.8 bcz it is not100% but that's not at all a problm. Bcz when comes too these range headphones these percentage is good enough ! (If we want 100% percentage noise cancellation nd much more sound and bass, should go for an over ear headphone like that range!!That type also available in boAt!) The last but not the least, that's about the add on things in the package! I like the cute pouch and sticker.... Bcz I am like a person who loves these kinds of lil cute things..!!  And Ofcourse extra ear- buds nd warranty card and a brochure like one also included! Overall, this is such a beautiful one type! A beautiful In ear headphone worth the price!! I loves this, boAt! Thank you for the Amazon,for safely deliver the product in this pandemic situation too, on the right time as mentioned in the order!! Thank you!❤️"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Average performance.,3.0,"After uses of 2 month it's one side pair are not working. But Really nice quality earphones and bass are superb.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Works very well for Gaming and Music and low key Sound Design,5.0,This is actually good. I was skeptical while buying it since it was the new Boat in ear model. But they didn't disappoint. It's actually good and even durable. I love it so much. However the extra ear pads might hurt your ears if worn too long but they are detachable. The sound quality is actually great too. I wanted something lowkey for video editing and gaming. This works perfect.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not worth,2.0,"I bought this earphone for audio call, but totally disappointed with the mic picking up external noise more than my voice. Also, not a good quality product for music listening in this price range. I missed to notice this product is non-refundable but replaceable, so no way to get it returned for a refund, beware!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money,5.0,Trust me this earphone is far much better than my 2000 Rs one plus bullet Z bass edition earphone. Sound quality is good. Bass is quiet low. But you can adjust with the quality for this price.Overall for people who are looking good budget friendly wired earphone please trust me and buy this.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Wonderful earphones,5.0,It's one of the best earphone under the range of 500 rupees. It product even contains cloth pouch .It's a light weight earphone.its has metal connector which makes its durable but becomes difficult to pull it out from earphone slot. Hope they could provide some grip on connector so that it could become easy to pull it out from computer.

Bass lovers will like this but it is a bit too much to my liking* Mic placement and clarity is greatCONS* Normal cable (not flat one as the pics suggest)* Experiencing sharp pain in the ears when using for 30+ minutes (biggest drawback)OVERALLDecent headphones but poor design which brings a lot of pain to your ears!

Quality of the headphone was good and also the sound quality too good. Bass and noise cancellation were little bit low, means out of 10 I'll give 8 for bass and noise cancellation and 9.5 out of 10 for sound quality and built quality.. And also it comes with a carrying pouch + 2 set extra ear buds both of their quality were awesome. Overall very good headphone guys.. just go for it.. highly recommended 👍👍"

A decent and good enough for the ears this headphones is. Good bass as mentioned, i use them for my PlayStation controller while gaming. A pouch too has been given to keep it safe after use. Good product for a good price."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),One of the worst product,1.0,I used thia product for not even a mobth. JThis product is extremely bad starting from the ear bud style. Followed by the bad 3.5mm jack. An extremely worse product and i am not sure if you can claim the warranty or any guarantee.  Total loss of money.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Waste of money,2.0,"Quality of materials and sound are not good,It feels like cheaper 100 rs product....!It's quality doesn't match with even It's cheaper siblings....!Don't buy....!And now amazon doesn't refund your money for electronic products.There are only replacement available..!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Go for it, best at this price @549",4.0,"Sound quality is great, very clear sound you can hear small details in background.Bass is good but could have been better.Mic is the best thing in this, it can capture your voice even at the distance of two ft.Only drawback is you feel pain after couple of hours of using.Over all good product, once you put this on you won't hear any sound around you. People need to tap my shoulder to call me ;)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Perfect Bass Heads !!,5.0,"The product it too good at this cost itself , there is even one year manufacturer warranty along with the it. T o be precise it a astonishing product. Moreover we don't need to buy separately the ear phone pouch to carry it , they are providing along with the earphones for free which is made of velvet cloth. I am feeling glad that my mom  gifted to me as a  diwali gift."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It's pathetic,1.0,"Just fell for the reviews, it's total crap. There is no high low mid bass and nothing it's just flat and sound like 50rs roadside earphones. Realme is 100times better than this, better avoid if you buy you will regret, since there is no return!!!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Pretty low bass. Name is misnomer. Otherwise one fine earphone,3.0,"Bass quality: is a bummer, though the name of this earphone is basshead 242, i feel base to be inferior and very inadequate to my taste as well as in contrast to the treble/ highs base feels rather weak.Sound profile: Clear sound. Dynamic range is ""Fine"" .Though the lack of bass makes it feel hollow. Don't go by the reviews calling it a great bass-y earphone, it's not.Good build quality- as per first impressions. Though I'm skeptical about how long it'll last.Noice Cancellation: No active cancelling(off course) but seals pretty well in ear canal so is quite adequat for isolation in a noicy bus joirney. Earphone is pretty loud.The higher end in the sound profile is overpowered. Sharp sounds are more prominent in comparison to base/lows."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worth the money!,4.0,"Review after about 3 months of usage:Since I've used both the Boat Bassheads 242 and Boat Bassheads 225 as well, the review is as a comparison between the two.Sound: Signature Boat sound. Almost same in both.Fit: 242s fit better.Design: 242s have an ear-friendly, plastic bud, 225s have large, metallic bud.Wire: 225s have tangle free wire.Jack: 225s have L-shaped jack.P.S. I felt like BRICK while writing this review. (For those who don't know, Brick is a character in a show called The Middle. That's all I can say.)Happy buying!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not Worth The price,2.0,"Boat 103 is far better than this, at a cheaper price with magnetic earbuds.. never waste your money on this product.Cons  - sound quality is poor especially at higher volumes  - poor bass performance  - No magnetic earbuds  - Jack is not good. It's not even an angled jack.  - Rubber tips/buds for this product sucks.. its bad.Pros  - It has a braided anti stretch cable.  - Nice ergonomics and looks good (depends on  perspective) & lot of colour choices.  - Its splash & sweat resistant.****** They say its IPX4, i haven't used it in such conditions to check this out"

It has a rubberized coating over the wires.ComfortIt takes 2 to 3 days to get use to with the ear hooks. And they work great it holds your ear firmly.ConclusionMust Buy earphones under Rs. 500, I got it at Rs. 399 during the sale, so always wait for the sale time.

Nice earclips (but may hurts if wear for a long time), Extra earbuds, Holder clip and a nice pouch also included. Bass is quite good, over sound is Ok. Its a budget headset, so can't expect much more. But, for daily use, it will satisfy use. I have purchased the Blue one, which is quite impressive look and sturdy. Let's see its durability."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),👍 Good to use but after knowing some things .,4.0,"I am writing the review after the use of almost 2 year .As I aspect sound quality is great . Full of bass and punchy sound and have great price as per the quality . Wire quality is also good dont reject it by its look , it is very durable bet for sports use but not good for calls .But after 14 month its one side earpiece stop working , its earcover comes out due to cheap quality . And the mic is not good since starting . Not audible during online classes .As per my review good to buy but last for short time and not for calls and online classes. So 4⭐⭐⭐⭐"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Broken heart with an broken headset,2.0,"I used this headset for about 8 months, And it broken link this without any reason.First the right side speaker stops working , then I was using this one sided hearing headset for 3 week's.Now by today that too stopped working.The only thing that is working Even now is the microphone ( I tested by doing an voice recording in phone).Its little weird for the headset to stop working and broken near this pin is awkward.I was an big fan of using the headset with moderate sound levels.So I always go with boat headset as its driver fits me perfect.But now I'm totally disappointed with this product and I suggest not to go with this product for purchase.Sorry for negative review.Peace & Thanks"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Lucky ear phones,5.0,5 star ratings is not for product. But it came lucky for me. Coz I had an Online interview with this new ear phones and got hired for the best job. Earlier I had attended many interviews with my old one but wasn't lucky enough. Surprisingly I had interviewed 4th one with this ear phone and have cleared all four.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Won't suit in long run,2.0,"I have been using it for a couple of months. The covers put on the housing part might not fit every individual. The covers on the sound filter tip are becoming loose after using it for a month or so, also the spare covers that came along, have different sizes so they won't fit if you miss your one of the cover. This is not good for running because the filter mesh will become dirtier quickly and you can't clean it. You might feel like throwing it away after you spoil the filter mesh and you won't feel like wearing it at all after that.Overall you will hate using this product after a month or two. The sound quality is good but the user experience is bad."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Budget Earphone,4.0,"Sound quality is really superb, No issues with sound quality output. Only thing I'm not satisfied is build quality., Could have been better. Wire is too thin and plastic quality is not good, could have been better. I hope they improve it. Other than worth the money."

At 50-60percent bass not good. Fitting to ear is good but can not put for long time. Started getting discomfort in some minutes of usage."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money,3.0,"BoAt is a good brand for bass I used this earphones before not now ( because I lost them somewhere) while I'm using them I feel grate but only thing disappointing is that ear hook Because of that my ears getting pain after 30min of use so I removed them problem solved I feel gud when I used these BoAt earphones later I tried the ""infinity"" brand zip 20 earphones after losing boAt just tried new but belive me my mind changed on BoAt after listening to infinity I mean infinity is better than BoAt because I observed the vocals, Tribble, noise cancelation, deep bass for rich quality just wow to infinity zip 20 it is better to choose infinity if u are looking for a decent and Cristal clear sound with deep bass .. if u want heavy bass go for BoAt my infinity earphones also lost one week back while trip so I ordered infinity zip20 again 💗Note : for better experience I'm using bass booster app"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good product,4.0,"As compared to Boult audio bass heads x1 , these earphones are very similar and the price of these headphones is higher due to these earphones has volume rockers and boult does not have.Other than that you would find everything same with higher price of ₹200.Also if you use them or put for 1 hour or more straight these earphones will hurt your ears. My ears started paining.Although these headphones are also good."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Descent earphone,5.0,"This is my second purchase. Good earphone. Bass is pretty good. Clear sound. Good outside noise cancelation. Light on ear and doesn't hurt.Only cons in this purchase, Boat has removed the outer  protective conduit from the wire which was earlier there in my first purchase.I don't whether it is duplicate or Boat has changed the design."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Stylish and cool but still lacks quality,3.0,I bought the earphones 5may received on 6th and the quality of sound is average but the style and looks are awesome.

Not good for exercise, walking etc, it comes off from ear.2. It doesnt fit into your ear properly.3. Noise cancellation is poor.4.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Cheap Quality Product and not at all durable,1.0,Earphones are of the cheapest quality I have ever seen. Its not even worth Rs 50/-Waste of money. I bought it for in-the-ear support. But the quality of the ear support is made of very delicate silicone and not even comfortable to fit in the ears. Also the whole ear phones quality is also worst. Even the Road side earphones would look more durable than this.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not a good choice for daily use,4.0,I bought my headphone and I am not using my remote much but after a week just on 6 September night I soon realized that the remote had a fault in it and oops I ran out of my return date a day before if you really want my suggestion then take boat 225 or 252 somewhat like that because I have used both and yes that is better than this productWorst product.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..........
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Paisa Vasool,5.0,I have been Fan of this company (boAt). Nice build quality. Unlike previous headphones (not boAt headphones) you can use boAt headphones roughly (keeping in your pockets or pull the (not too hard) mistakely). It will sustain and can work atleast 7 to 8 months. Good life shelf. The price was bit more i felt.The sound is way better than any other headphones (at this price)
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Sound quality,5.0,"First of i just love the design nd fit finish, then talking about it's feel in ears is good, tips are soft enought nd due to earhooks this don't fall of like boat 240 in earphones, first thig you will notice when you pulg those in your ears is is half of the outside noize is reduced nd the sound you hear is crisp nd clear with a good bass with it's 19mm drivers. Mic on this is something differnt, you'll feel like this has a active noice cancellation on, Cabel use on this earphones is also of good quality. What else you want from a 500rs earphone. Nd you can use it for gaming it goes well with it to. 🙂"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money!!!,5.0,For the money for which we are getting this headphones it works like charm and do the basic things right. Eliminates the surround sound but it’s far away from noise cancellation feature which is technically not possible to include in the package. Fare amount of bass can be enjoyed and the quality of the sound is good.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Very durable hassle free headphones,5.0,I am impressed by the durability and quality of the headphones. The wires are especially nice and do not tangle easily. I was also looking for ear phones that I could wear during workout and resistant to sweat and moisture. These fit the bill nicely.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Can be better at higher price,4.0,"I have used worse earphones that cost more than this, this is pretty good at this price , that being said if only boAt is seeing this review I want you to listen to me. The ear phones are pretty comfortable regardless it being 10mm driver it fits little too well that it doesn't completely seal my ears even after using the largest silicon tip , I want boAt to introduce new product as such but with a bigger driver make 12.5 or even 15mm."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best in the range no debate.,5.0,"Best piece of earphones I have ever bought period. And boy, have a bought a ton of expensive ones through these years. I only base this off the awesome sound quality. It's ethereal, highs, lows, bass you name it. I had skullcandys and bose ones thinking honking bass is the real thing, but these ones make me realise how wrong I was. Great overall sound quality, the melody comes just perfect through the bass which is not underwhelming by any stretch of the imagination. I bought it for 800 rupees, if you get it for less than 2k, it's a steal. (Slight exaggeration)The build is awesome too, the wire looks cool, durable and won't wind up making your life difficult. I hope this lasts as this is my second day of listening to it.10/10"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worth for 399/-,5.0,"Got it during Amazon great festivalUsing since 2 weeks.. sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality is good for music hearing and YouTube videos so far. Working good and fitting ears without paining, so far. Recommend"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),For ₹499 budget it's Consideredable !,5.0,"After using for 2 months the best I can say is it's worth of money but not for base lovers, if you prefer Indian brand it's good for you, you even get warranty period which is useful (not really lol), a pouch and yes some ear buds which were missing from my box , and that Sucks the most .🥲"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good headphone with good quality,3.0,"I purchased this headphone because of WFH and have following review:Pros: Good quality build ,sound is great, light weight, good material is used, delivered on time,packging was good, fit in ear perfectly.Cons: It has button for stop/play, volume up and down and surprised that it didn't work. During my zoom/google call through laptop I tried this buttons and none of them was working. Although i rely heavily on mouse and control volume/stop/play with mouse so not a big issue for me but it should work as it is provided and for that we have charged. So i have given 3 stars otherwise it deserve 4.5."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not compatible with LG G6,4.0,Not compatible with my LG G6 mobile. I have to rotate its jack little to see where it will play. Wire quality is good and it will work for long time. Sound quality is also good. Should have madr universal compatible device. My previous eaephone was of boult loop wired earphone. It was good in sound and was compatible but its wire was not as good as this.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Everything for ₹500 except the fit.,3.0,"12 days after buying this.Pros-1.Sound profile of this earphone is good.Bass,Sound,treble everything is well balanced.2.Build quality is superb too, even tho it's entirely made out plastic.Cons-1.Even after nearly wearing this for close to couple of weeks,I don't like the fit of this earphone, they should excellent but they just don't fit me. If you want a better fit go with the ""realme buds 2"".2. These looks cheap as hell.Cons-"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),earphones good,4.0,"earphones are good but its connector (the black thing by holding whom we plug in and out the earphones from phones ) is very slippery. when your phones are plugged in and  if your hands are little oily or watery( like after eating some food or after washing hands) then its not easy to plug out the earphones. ou have to use some cloth to plug out the earphones.The connector  should not be slippery . it should be rigid to hold.Rest earphones sound is clear , base is awesome in price range."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Great Design and Sound Quality , only con is the thin wires",5.0,"It's a great product from Boat. I needed a earphone which I could use while riding & this serves the purpose very well. The ergonomic Design helps the earphone to stay in place without hurting or having stress on your ears. Additional feature of Volume control helps to reduce or increase volume without having the need to take out your phone.Sound Quality : 9/10Design : 7/10 ( 7 Because of thin wires)Cons : The only risk I identified is the thin wires. Since I'm using it during riding, I am not sure how long these thin wires will last. It would have been a perfect design if they had used the Flat wire design in this particular model.Overall a Good product with a risk of Wire getting stretched & damaged."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best VFM at ₹399..!!!,4.0,No doubt gives a perfect & above decent acoustics..!!steal deal at ₹399..Looks well made (can last long for sure)go for it..one star less:you should reduce last 2 volume points to have smoother effects for bass/treble rich songs ( voice rich songs are classy n not an issue )..
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),A Good headset.,5.0,I am no techi. But for normal people looking for a wired headset . This is a good one.Packing was good.Sealed pack.Headset was good .Better sound quality compared to normal headset.Noise cancellation wad better.Wires are not as delicate as normal headset.  Definitely better quality.  Clip is provided so can be fixed to shirt  .

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Seemed fake,2.0,"I bought this for the second time because the first 1 is amazing! I've been using mine for almost a year and it is absolutely amazing till date. So, I decided to buy another one, this time for my sister. The product arrived within a day but the performance was so terrible I think it was fake. The bass was bad and the audio wasn't centered. It felt as if the sound was coming from the left side no matter what I was listening to. Disappointed. Service was amazing tho. They picked up the return within a day of requesting for a refund."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best product ever,5.0,"These headphones are epic the sound quality is best ever. The noise cancellation also cancels a lot of noise but not too much, u can still hear whats happening in the background a little bit. They aare very comfortable there is just one problem that after wearing them for 2 Or 3 hrs ur ear starts itching. But over all it is good. If u want them for gaming I would not reccomend these as u can get better over ear headphones specifically for gaming."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Okay earphones,3.0,"I liked the earphones however I can feel the audio to be more left sided than balanced. I tried this on various devices and the effect had been the same. Also, the mic quality is not up to the mark. I am a singer and I sing using the mic to record songs, the output is, nope.Otherwise, if you just want to listen to the audio, go for it."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not recommended at all,2.0,The cost is a way higher in comparison to the product and sound quality. The sound quality is not that great. It has weak bass quality as well. More of all the design is the worst problem with it. It starts hurting your ears in very short interval of time. The sharp edges in the design keep poking your ears badly. Not recommended at all.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not for gamers,3.0,"If you are buying this product for music,it's good within this price range ...go for it...But if your buying this product for battleground games then this earphone is not for that..it has high bass which is definately not good for gaming and it's not comfy if u r using for 2 3 hours straight....Except this gaming part everything's fine.....noise cancellation is good,bass is good,you may face a littlebit of dissatisfy in term of sound...as the bass is too high the sound is a bit low...but u will not notice it...overall it's good...if u r a music lover nd only buying it for music,u should definately try this."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Disappointed,1.0,"I've been using Boat for atleast half a decade and it's been pretty well. I've bought a ton of Boat products. But this time Boat Bassheads 242 is a big disappointment. It stopped working in a month and they repaired it (not replaced) then again it stopped working in 3 months, again they repaired it (not replaced). And again in the fifth month it has stopped working. TBH I am not even gonna get it replaced because Im fed up of the services. Boat just lost a customer.P.S. - I keep my earphones/headphones really nicely and I used this product even less."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Excellent,5.0,One of the finest i have used ..its has an amazing sound quality ..they fit so well blocking almost 90% of outside noise .

So you can use it when you are jogging or running.Additional advantage for it is having volume control buttons.One thing you need to consider, you cannot feel pure bass in this price segment. If you want pure bass, you should go for higher price. Because it is having high sound not high bass. Bass lovers should go for over the ear headphones with high prices."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Can't use for long time,2.0,"Writing the review after 2months of use.. noise cancelation is good but not better.  Bass quality is very good.. but it can be used for max 1 and a half hour not more than that.. we'll get earache.. if you are using this for less than 1 hour continously,  then its good👍"

The sound quality is so great and the noise cancellation is so perfect. The design of this earphone makes it it perfectly fit in ears. This earphone will be a perfect competition for JBL. I have used earphones of different brands like JBL, syska, Ptron, Boat. But this one is something else I like this sound bus and also design very match. If it comes under 500 just go for it.Sound Quality: 4.5/5Noise Cancellation: 4/5Bass Quality: 4/5"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),BETTER THAN THE BOAT BASSHEADS 225,5.0,"Literally the best earphones in the price range. The 10mm drivers thump a good bass, but not the best. Very comfortable and stays in ears with the hooks on. Better than the boAt bassheads 225 of the same price range. The boAt bassheads 225 are very bad for using while sleeping. But these are better compared to those and these also have in-line volume controls and are absent in the bassheads 225. I highly recommend these instead of boAt bassheads 225."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Nice comfortable headphones during wfh,5.0,I am writing this review post using this extensively for calls during work from home for 5 months - it fits well in ears and you hear good sound  both music and callsDidn't felt any issue for long usageI again bought this for my wife and she is using it - though now every one uses ear pods and blue tooth headset I feel comfortable using this for laptop callsOnly con the earbuds though they provided few extra however at times this gets detached from the headset and if you don't have a spare available you won't be able to use
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Happy to have it,4.0,Sound quality sturdiness all good i just gave 4 stars because some improvements are needed like the fitting of sleeves becomes inconvenient after a use of 2-3 months as in my case they fall off while removing the earbuds or gets stuck in the ears. It becomes irritating if it happens frequently.Rest good🎉🎊🎉
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not for longer use,3.0,I am giving this product 3 star. This product quality is very good I can say the best earphone I have seen bust the problem with this is that this product cannot be use for longer time.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best to listen songs. Not good at all foe calling and watching movie.,4.0,"I like everything about this but the only one and the worst problem is that while talking on the call, I received my voice back and can’t hear talk at all. While watching any movie the voice is very less.Only good to listen songs thats all.I want to return it but the return option has been closed on 19th by Amazon.Please help and suggest how to return?My contact information:-Mob - 8003722817Mail- djvickron11@gmail.com"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Faulty earphones,1.0,"Although my family uses boat brand earphones, but this time the product turned out to be faulty. There comes a constant disturbing sound during phone calls just like an old fan blade moving. The product was used much later as we never thought there could be any fault in boat brand but we were wrong. Should have tested when received. Time period to return the same had lapsed too."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Boat Bassheads 242.,4.0,"If you are looking for just loud bass this might be perfect, but if you want a clear quality bass this might not be a good one. The sound is loud and sometimes sharp which might make it difficult to listen to it for a long time. Also the shape and extra rubber support gives a bit of pain after long usage.For 500 bucks this is a good earphone."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Build quality is not good as expecting,2.0,"hello everyone, if you are going to buy this earphone, i would suggest you to not buy this because of its built quality. Instead of this earphone you can buy same company product like boat 220/225 earphone because it comes with flat wire ( tangle free) and has a awesome built quality and i have been using this boat 220/225 earphone since March,2020. Its far better than this boat 242 earphone."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good pair of earphones for the price,4.0,"I got the pair in blue color for 499/- and for the price, the earphones are good. The Mic is well placed so the audio quality to the other person is great and the buttons are tactile and easy to operate. The soft velvet pouch that comes with it is good too.The only con would be the 2 thin wires from the connector to the earbuds, so it needs delicate usage."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),अमेज़न के कर्मचारी चोर है।,1.0,"पैकेट में बिल भेज दिया, सामान गायब था। शिकायत करने के बाद भी अमेज़न अपने चोर कर्मचारियों का बचाव करता है। मै दावे के साथ कहता हूं कि लखनऊ अमेज़न  स्टोर में चोर कर्मचारी हैं जो सामान पैकेट में नहीं रखते हैं, मात्र बिल भेज दे रहे है।"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Didn't even last 2 months,2.0,"I don't recommend this product. I trusted the brand name and thought it will last longer. But seems like, there is no difference between a 100rs earphone and this one. Didn't even last 2 months. Extremely disappointed"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Bought for 400 , best in this range",4.0,"Pros-Excellent sound quality even at volume 2.Earphone Pouch.Length cable.Fast delivery in one day with no delivery charge.Volume and pause play button.Cons-No heavy bass (not for bass lavers).Very Thin cable ( I dono how many days it will come, but good thing is it comes with 3layer fibber let's hope best).No L shaped 3.5mm jack.No gold plated 3.5mm jack.The design is made of plastic no metal, it looks cheap.Ear hook hurts but u can removeMy final verdict is if u r melody lover don't waste even a sec just but it ,if you r a bass lover go for some other products."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Terrible audio and broke in the 1st week,1.0,Saw a review on youtube that said the audio was very clear. It wasnt. Audio is heavily bass boosted for no reason which is alright for some music but makes every other video i watch sound very muffled. On top the volume is amplified very heavily to the point where the minimum sound setting is still 3x as loud as other earphones can go. So couldnt use the earphones to listen to songs as i slept because the volume was too loud. Finally earphones statted producing loud static white noise making them unusable after 1 week. Horrible product all around. Just buy jbl or samsung for budget brand.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Piece of advice: Always go for L-shaped pin,2.0,"This earphone is very decent overall. Sound quality, comfortability wise, this product is value for money.The only thing which itches is its build quality. Not very durable (the wire is not flat shaped or tangle free). Wire coating is very ordinary. And the worst of all, the shape of pin. Never go for straight pin. It is a nightmare. Taking it out from the jack is basically a invitation for rapid wear and tear. And it's not super convenient either. I wonder why Boat decide to ditch the L-shaped pin for this model."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money,5.0,"It's a really good one wired earphone.The sound quality is pretty good. I usually listen music with 70-80% volume. In good quality audio file or gaming side it's enough.Don't try to go for full volume as bass is not that high, it's unbearable on ears.Quality is good. You will also get different size of buds which suits your ear."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),After an year of usage,4.0,"The cable for this product comes with a rubber kinda laminated upon, it feels durable for a long time, it survived hitting a ceiling fan accidentally. But the problem comes with the earpiece, you'll find a net protecting the speaker which comes loose and can get damaged, it happened with me, would be better if it is built with plastic. Sound quality is amazing , noise cancellation done well, bass quality is fair for what Boat takes, i am also using JBL 650btnc, a premium headphone priced 10k. For my regular use, Boat gets on me more than JBL."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),A good product if it works,1.0,"I was a boat fan untill this purchase .you should be lucky to enjoy this ""quality product"" .I was not lucky enough bcoz my product stopped work within two Weeks. mailing them again and again ,they respond once and said their courier partner rejected .Now I'm listening music directly from my phone speaker while I'm typing this and looking at that new box ( couldn't even get the taste 😐)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worth the price,4.0,"Its Good for the price.Build Quality : 3/5Comfort : 3/5 , the rubber Thingy along with the ear dips are not very confortableLooks 4/5, colour is very niceSound:-Clearity: 3.5/5Bass: 2/5Treble: 4/5,  its too high in higher volumesCall Quality: 5/5, mic is good and clear calls are expected.  Overall and very good value for money product."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),One earbud is missing when I recieved this product,4.0,"When I was received this product, one eartip was missing. But I have another pair of eartips(not in the box included I used) I have to my broken earphones That I used it to this earphones.Now it is fine and usable. It's not that much problem to worry about it. But audio quality was extraordinary. Bass and audio is louder than I expected. I will recommend it if anybody asked me which headset i would buy. It is value for money earphones."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not worth the price,3.0,"I'm writing this review after 6 months of usage.Initially I was ok but slowly i started facing problems.1) The wire entangles a lot. Since the wire is not slippery material it becomes difficult to straighten it up.2) The silicon holders come out easily. but its somehow locked in the earpiece so it wont fall off and lost so its a smaller problem3) The silicone caps come out easily. I lot it couple of times, luckily find it out and now being extra careful. Few times it was left in my ear itself. Funny.4) the buttons on the mouth piece are pretty hard and clunky.Although its not all hopeless stuffSound quality is satisfactory, Bass is good"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Best earphones, amazing bass and sound quality!",5.0,"This is one of the best earphone purchases made by me. It has an amazing sound and bass quality, fits well into my ear and has good noise cancellation. I always find trouble finding good earphones because most of them do not fit into my ear and falls off. This one has a good design and fits well into the ear, the build quality is very good. The mic works very well too. My voice was heard clearly on the other side during calls. It works well on both mobile and laptop. The price is also extremely reasonable for this quality. I would 100% recommend to buy this headset."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst experience 😪,1.0,Was good for 1 weekAfter a week some loose connection problems in the jackReturned the product but not refunded stillDaily we are calling to boatThey're telling we will send u new product within a weekBut it's about 1 month after returning the productWorst
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It's okay,3.0,"Just got it. Listened some old Kishore Kumar songs. Not impressed. Probably the right thing what ₹399 can get. MRP is ₹1,490 which is surely a marketing tact. Comes with a pair of extra buds and a carrying pouch and a clip. It's too early to comment on it's IPX4 water resistance. For sub ₹500 it's okay.1st edit: it tangles."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Don't expect too much,4.0,Pros :• Good fit and light weight.• Satisfactory build quality.• Good Bass and sound profile.• Decent length.Cons :• In line remote's play-pause button malfunctions sometimes i.e takes too long to respond or triggers google assistant.• Vocals in music are not very clear. Don't expect exceptional sound quality.Conclusion : Buy in sales at ₹399 or less otherwise not recommended at ₹500+. Other option is Realme buds 2.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not recommended but read the review to find out if you like them,3.0,"Good earphones if you want heavy bass. The mic is excellent and the fins don't hurt your ears as I thought they would. They also have a 1 year warranty so that's nice.BUT: As is with a lot of boAt products, they have durability issues. The thin wire on the earbuds is easy to wear out and within 6 months of usage I have managed to screw up the right earbud. I use them a bit roughly like anyone using them for casual listening and various locations would."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best but due to my issue not,2.0,"When I attach this earphones sometimes it's not show in icon bar, and when I play game Like Call of duty mobile, from this earphone beep sound continuously comes my friend get irritated with this, I have test this earphone in various phone same issue detected, now I can not replace earphone,But listening music good watching videos good but  when I play games and try to chat with friends this issue comes Permanently, when I use different earphone every thing is ok I think it's cause of defective mike inside earphone."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Boat has lost its prestige and quality,1.0,I am highly disappointed this is the second ear phone post replacement i get rhe same kind of piece it doesnt fit correctly not sturdy and if it does ..u cant wear for more than a hour..the sound ìs very low even in the highest volume compartively feom othr brand and old boat earphones
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The best boAt earphones out there in this price range - period.,5.0,"If you're looking to bypass the obnoxious overly loud bass of 225, want an in-line mic close to the mouth ALONG with volume controls (a feature that I literally haven't seen in any other earphones of this range) - this is it.A must-have for anyone looking for a good enough overall music experience with easy voice calling & volume control, comfort fit, and the best loudness level - all with great affordability. I spent hours looking (and returning) earphones, so you don't have to. Simply go for it."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good design but doesn't deliver on bass performance,4.0,Decent headphones but doesn't have excellent bass output. I found Boult bass buds X2 better in bass performance in similar price range.The flexible ear clips attach to the ear nicely and doesn't slip off like other earphones. Good design.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Dont buy this product . Review after 1 month.,1.0,Don't buy this product. Believe me its not working after 1month. Usually iam boat product fan. I bought this for the first time after my previous boat headphone becomes old. After 1 month mike not working at all. It automatically changes volume. Over all its a mess. Other end person cannot hear me at all. Don't buy this u will regret. Go for nor boat earphone(399 rs ) one . Or some other product.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Bass is good but sharp sound gets distorted.,4.0,The bass is quit good but when the it comes to the sharp sounds it distort them and gives a fuzzy noise in the background. The build quality looks quite cheap for the brand and as I have used many products from the house of BOAT.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Strictly for bassheads. Otherwise dont bother buying this.,2.0,"Firstly i got a defective product, which got promptly replaced.Sound Quality:Like the name suggestes, this is purely for baseheads, the lows over power the mids & highs. Sound stage is very narrow and lacks instrument separation. Mids-vocals and treble is recessed and lacks in detail. Even the bass is lose. Overall not a great sounding earphones unless you are a basshead and dont care for overall sound quality and u just need bass, only then u can go for this earphone."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Defect earphone,2.0,"Hello everyone,I have received this headphone today 16/10/2021. I had placed on order based on the best rating reviews of customers and this experience is been worst I can say it so disappointing me that the headphone sound quality is so poor there is no bass it is just a flat normal sound with some weird hit tap tap on left headphone also the volume (-) button isn't working. The response of volume & pause button isnt quick. I would request the dealer to replace this item with a new piece.Thanks,"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good fit but not so great sound,4.0,"This maybe just a manufacturing defect but it is slightly panned to the right. Triggers someone who's really into music and sound. The so called ""Drivers"", jar when a part with good bass kicks in. These earphones are naturally too loud. I don't use more than 20% of the phone volume because of how loud it is. I am not a fan of bass-heavy earphones. I like it more balanced. But I bought these because of the fit. It stays in my ear no matter what. The buds did hurt me in the beginning but I got used to it. Didn't have the budget to buy the airpods so I got these"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good quality with up to the mark functioning!👌,4.0,"Good product with excellent sound quality, very good noise cancellation and nice bass quality only issue is bit highly priced. Colour and quality is exactly as shown in pictures."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best headphone with quality at this price range.,5.0,Sound quality is very good I have to check multiple Hollywood movies Bollywood movies event remix and much more..Kannoj cancellation is very much ethical.. if you are inside the train or at house you will get scold by your parents by not answering their calls.. it's that much cool.With this headphone you can listen Badshah songs with their original bass.. same goes for David Guetta music videos..I personally love this headphone and I purchased three others for my sisters and brother.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Value for money,4.0,No matter what kind of earphone you are buying from boat it will always have only one issue 'bass'.Though I have to change my earphone twice because it's Jack wasn't working. It's warranty period wasn't over so it's normal for me to get a new one.Though they always delay the process of customer service and change.But soon it's going to 1 year since I have brought it so it's worth my money.Cheap wired earphones even won't last for a month. But I used it to1 year so it's okay
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),very nice earphones fa bass luvers,3.0,very nyc exp with this earphones. i used nearly fa one month and i am reviewing this.  aftr contn use of abt 1hr it starts paining .  there is silica coating on this red colour. so if anybody is specific about the coating select it correctly.worth for money..  long enough wire so that u keep the mobile in pants and wires reach ears comfortably..  clips to hold on to shirts very useful..  mic at the midway of right ear wire is really useful while driving..
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),REALLY GOOD FOR THE PRICE,5.0,These earphones are really worth it for the price of 449. The ear hooks are just like a fashion or for just good appearance the ear hooks dont just fit comfortably in the ears other the earphones are simply great. The bass is just really good 10 mm dynamic drivers. The earphones cable quality is also good. Overall it is a value for money product. Do give it a try.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good Earphones. Nice backup,5.0,"Its a good product overall for the price point. It has regular attributes like a normal earphone. Low bass, high treble and sometimes ridiculously high volume when the volume is max. It fits perfectly in my ear and has been 3 months since I have purchased it. The earphones for me works like a backup if my air dopes or my headphones aren't working at that point of time. I have no idea of regular use though."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worth money. Good sound quality. It's a best choice,5.0,"Guys this is a must buy item! It have a really good sound quality. Noise cancellation is also good. And the bass quality is next level. If you want to check the sound quality and bass quality of the earphone check it with bohemian rhapsody : we will rock you, because this song have many different instrument play in all high and low tune.  I'm reviewing after 2 months of use. It has a good ear grip. PACKAGE INCLUDES: 1 boat earphone, 2 pairs of ear buds, 1 velvet cover fot keeping earphone safely in backpack or pocket while travelling. It's really worth money."

That's the reason I ordered 1 more earphone for my friend...Superb, awesome, best, value for moneyRating: 10/10 ( in every parameters)"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Boat 225 is better than boat 242 😑,3.0,Overall product is good but the right side of the earphone is always defective (has no bass) . I would suggest to purchase boat 225 instead of boat 242. I am using boat 225 for nearly 9 months and there is no sign of wear n tear or defect. I am using boat 225 all day non-stop but also in very good condition. This boat 242 i purchased and first time came right side defective and then again after replacement also same problem arised. ....................................
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Think twice before orderly,2.0,"If you are going to purchase it, think twice before taking such step. I have been using this product since June 2021 and it started showing problems after 1 month of use, so far I have managed to go with this. But now I have frustrated with this. There is a problem in right earpiece, when ever I am talking to some person the earpiece starts producing buzz sound and sometimes there is a click click sound if you move your head even a little bit. But I stable mode it's sound quality is very good."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Average Product,2.0,Have used the product for about 3 hours and it hurts around the ears due to hard plastic body. Bass is just at the basic level like any other headphone. Sound quality is nothing better than any other normal headphone available this is an honest review. The wire quality is awesome and looks trendy but lacks sound quality. Not really happy with the purchase.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good ones,4.0,"Good balanced sound for daily use. Soft eartips and the included buds of different sizes are comfortable. The lime green colour is easy to recognise in a black bag, and is not gaudy or too flashy. The only slight negative is that the white eartips show even the slightest of earwax. So, you'll want to keep cleaning them."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Kinda okayish earphones. Good for casual use. Bad for making calls and consistent use.,4.0,"First Impression : Feels kinda premium. It feels like it could get a bit further in to the ear. Not a firm fit. The green one has much damper color, not same as in the picture. Volume is way good. Overall not bad.After 1 month : REALLY BAD MIC. Longer use is uncomfortable due to the design, if you smile or do any facial expression, it does hurt and irritate. More treble than bass. Volume buttons are very helpful.Casual music listeners, joggers...etc etc go for it.If you are going to use this for calls, don't buy this."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Worst product, by at your own expense",1.0,"Thanks for giving me a worthless product.After a week, since u brought the product, the left side of the headphone was sounding less than the right side, gradually it got worse, now it's on the way of destroying my mobile. My mobile is getting hang because of this headphone. Thanks for giving me a defective product. Now I nit only wasted 500 rs, but also stuck with it, because there's no more return policy."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Nice,4.0,I use it as a daily  gameCons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and also you feel discomfort whiling using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Average product,3.0,"I would it is a good product i viewed lots of video they say it has good bass but in my view the bass average i previously used oneplus buds wireless and currently have realme buds wireless 2 but the loudness far better its like a horn in ear very loud unbearable, the build quality and mic quality is great. It can be a great product if the bass was improved but i u are not a bass lover you can buy it, thanks for reading"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"It is Nice, but a warning!",4.0,"Just got the delivery. Wires are way thinner than i thought. Bass and sound are fine. I don't know if it will last long. Hope it does. Joints are also very sensitive. They claim that it's water proof but, the previous version i bought (bassheads 242), went crazy when exposed to a little sweat. So, not gonna take a leap of faith with this one. Will also advice anyone to do the same. Other than that, i am happy that an indian brand is providing such great products."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Bad quality product recieved,2.0,"I bought this product on April 1st and by today that is after almost 20 days the right side ear bud is starting to malfunction whenever the wire is moved. May be I have recieved the bad quality product and also it states it has 1 year warranty and i jave only used it for like 20 days almost.Apart from this sound quality is very good, bass is also very good and noise cancellation is satisfying. I would have given it a 5 star but due to the malfunction of the eaephone I can't. If you are buying this product make sure that u got a good product and not a damaged one."

Tried it on my smartphones (with PowerAmp, manual Eq). I am pretty sure Sony can't offer this performance at this price.Given the price, this is the last bargain guys.WOW! Not comparing Sony here. It was just an adjective!It didn't come no near to my Sony XB. But it's worth the money, on discount, surely"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),For the price range - Amazing,5.0,These are too good if you ask me for the price range. Didn't expect an earphone to be so good at this price range. It sits up pretty well in your ears and you wont have to keep the volume 100 at any point of time. It is so good that in indoors even 60-70% volume does it. Probably when you go out and there is a lot of noise will you have to keep the volume at 80-90%. Go for it eyes closed.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The earphone are fine for the first 2 daysONLY,1.0,"I got boat earphone thinking the qaulity of these will be marginally more tusting or superior, but i have again been let down.The earphone were working perfectly for only 2-4 days after delivery- this made me think all is well. So I thew away my packaging. Rookie Mistake. DO NOT THROW THE PACKAGING.After the first 4 days the mic completely died. Making me thin something is wrong with my phone or laptop, but not the earphones(AS THEY WERE JUST 4 DAYS OLD!)Anywho now they are lying around in  the house. The only value it adds is maybe the pop of color it brings to my messy drawer in which they lie buried."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),duplicate is also available looking like same,4.0,"First received duplicate item I think, there was no bass when hearing and heared unwanted voices . This duplicate item was as same as original.  Then ordered replacement which I received was perfect. Didn't expect this. I had missing pouch in both original and replacement order. Didn't receive it.Overall the replacement was original, quality is good and worth for money during sale."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not that comfortable.,4.0,"Sound quality wouldn't disappoint you.. It's superb..The only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for comfort in ear.. I'm not saying that it's uncomfortable ..But it's not that comfortable too.. I can keep it in my ear for around an hour..After that it starts paining..So it's quite difficult for me to watch a full movie continuously with the earphone.. So as far as the comfort issue is concerned, I would say it's okay okay.."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Look&Feel, Sound Quality",4.0,"1= Sound Quality is best in this Headphone, But some time bass was starting struggle, But if your phone have a Equaliser then adjust the bass in Your Style.2= The Built quality,  Built quality was really superb i mean in the case of built quality, This is a killer headphone.3= A wire quality was also superb, Dobble couted Wire with rubber protection.4= i am test this headphone in rain its really work good in rain."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),super cool and funky,5.0,"These earphones are super cool. It has all features I want that is Volume up/down, Received and end call, mic, can change song, pause and play button. I love this earphones. I bought it for my brother too who has iphone so these earphones are fully compatible with iphone too.The green color is also very bright and funky."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It is not what I expected,2.0,Sound Quality is not that great Sound is pretty flat / bass is totally 0.Build quality of the wires is good but the ear piece part is made up of cheap plastic and too light.I also have Boat Airdopes 381 which has 7mm drivers their sound quality is much better than this wired earphone. This time boat let me down.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),specs of this earphones are gr8,4.0,"hats off to Amazon for the delivery, I literally received the earphones in less than 18-19 hours. Product is marvellous in sound quality, bass quality is good tho. The reason i gave 4 stars is because of the pain which causes to my ears when am using it for a long time. Overall it’s a must buy earphones."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Bass is too loud.,4.0,"Bass is very high. It doesn't sound good. BoAT should improve the bass quality.Also, wire seems less durable.However at this price no other good options are available."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Regret regret and only regret.,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Don't buy this earphone. I give 1 star becoz of quality of wire, quality of wire is ok. Sound is decent, no bass. After sometime of use one side earpiece is stop working.If you don't believe me buy it and regret it later. I am regreting to buy this product. I usually dont write a review of any product which I buy from amazon, but today I write this review for you people, becoz you don't waste you hard earn money on this product."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The sound quality is not consistent. Do not bother buying this product.,1.0,"As I have used boat products earlier and never had any problem with quality, I opened and after testing the product once, threw away the box. That was a mistake, only after 1 day of working properly, the speaker volume became very low, even when the volume was full from my end. Through mike worked well, and other person was able to hear me, we could not carry on any conversation. As I did not keep the box, now I am stuck with this non functional product. My sincere suggestion, do not waste your time with buying this. There are several other brands that have wired headset at similar price point."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Ok for the price but wouldnt recommend,3.0,"The bass quality is bad, due to high treble is quite high and due to this unable to hear voice with clarity.Ok for the price but wouldnt recommend for others based on my experience."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Ok not good,2.0,"Sound quality  is not good , uncomfortable  , sound is very loud , it be uses for calling not for music,  at this price 500 we can say ok , but  I can't  reccomend  this to by who want to use for long time it can damage ear"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,1.0,3rd Class Wire Quality.Maximum Price should be Rs. 50 OnlyAndCOUNTRY OF ORIGIN - CHINATRUELY REFLECTING IN ITS QUALITY.

I love the boat & Amazon for Best products.  Come to the Pro's &  Con's , there is a no Con's on this Headphone.

That's it guys  I hope it's helpful you, thank you 😊😊."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Quality earphones in affordable range,5.0,"One of the best products ever introduced by boat.This review is based on 6 months use of this product.Al though it is the first time I have used this model from boat, but I have to admit that I bought it after lots of references from different sources and I wasn't disappointed.It's build quality is flawless; applaud the use of double coated wire with the braided mesh.Sound quality is the best in this price range catagory.Treble and bass is balanced, still you can hear a minor vibration at high volume but it's not that distinguished. It is the side effect of all the long hours I have put in this."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),SHAPE IS HURTING,3.0,"Sound quality is very good, but its shape hurts. After 1/2 an hour may ear starts paining. Only negative I found its almost 45 degree anguler shape. I am using boat rockers 255 pro, and its shape is good for me, do not hurt."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Loved the product.,4.0,"I have bought these boat bassheads 242 and the sound output is awesome.I can say this since I've use JBL, Skullcandy, and others in the past.And these really match to the level of others I mentioned above.As far as look is concerned, the look very sporty and amazing.If anyone is considering a wired earphones below Rs 500 and yet expecting quality output, these are your pick for sure."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),worst design,1.0,"worst design ever. Long term use gives pain in ears. The extra rubber given on top of earphone is of no use. At least they could have given magnets for both the speakers, so that the wires don't get tangled.No designing features in this earphone, Its old model only.Use it continuously for 1 hour and your ears 👂 hurt. Its one of the worst design ever.Check the lesser price earphones, they have the latest designing features."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Nothing to say more just kiddoo !!!,4.0,The boat bass head earphone is just awesome one that I have used till.The ergonomic design just made to get awful feel to the user.The quality of wire is outstanding than the other branded ones which is on same price slot.It also provided two extra buds to fit those who needs it.They have got covered the wire with a rubber kinda material..for avoiding it from cracking.Overall the earphone nailed it in the 549 rps style.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Great Sound quality And Pretty nice bass.,4.0,So I just received earphone two days before. I am writing this review after using it for 2 days.Sound all over great.Bass I would say not that good but its pretty nice at this price. So you can actually hear music great no problem at all. I would say the build is actually good at this price.The earphone is also good and it doesn't cause pain in ears while using. I used for continuous 3 to 4 hours no pain at all.Overall Good soundNot great but nice bass.But at this price range it is good
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Too much bass leads to muffled dialogue sound.,2.0,"The earphones were very uncomfortable the first time I tried them on but I thought I might get used to it. Turns out comfort was not the only issue with them. I know boAt is known for it's bass but what I didn't know is that it'd be at the expense of a good overall hearing experience. The bass is so high that it actually ends up muffling the dialogues and other sounds. I can see their use in rock music but in a normal movie ? Nope, not the right choice. Also, did I mention that they are not at all comfortable even after a few days of usage ? Anyways, I am going to return them. Hope I get a refund and not a replacement.P.S. - The Samsung original earphones were the BEST."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Stopped working after only a 30 MINUTE RUN!!!,1.0,"Had bought this so that I can use it for running, stopped working in one ear right after a 30 minute run, didn't tug or pull the wire, it was the sweat!! They advertise it as sweatproof but I doubt they have even done the bare minimum. The audio quality on the other hand is trash. Try spending a little more and go for better earphones if you want to use them in the gym or while running."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Avoid Boat if possible,1.0,"I am using it for almost 1 month . As a honest person I will recommend you to avoid boat products , boat products are only a hype in the market .I will recommend everyone to to go for mi or realme earphones .this boat 242 earphone have very cheap build quality and are always prone to any defect. My earphone's mic is not working and even warranty services are not good."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Designed to break!,2.0,"I have bought this earphone 5 times and all of them gave me one common problem after 5-6 month of usage, any one side would stop working. Turns out it has been made to look strong from outside but has poor wiring at 3.5mm jack internally and the plastic used for ear bud is of very poor quality as it breaks easily."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good value for money.,2.0,"Likes: It's a good value for money.  Good bass, so good for music.Dislikes: can't use for long duration, causes pain in ear due to buds.Since bass is high, hence voice quality for calls is not so good.But over all I say with this price tag it's value for money"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Quality and product,1.0,Please dont purchase these earphones.Issue of noice cancellation is just irritating.Need to plugin and plugout again and again cause of cheap bass qualityLot of disturbance during play ⏯️Automatic mike gets startedNeed to adjust the plugin by rotating which is ridiculous.Starting it was good but after a month its just horrible.Amazon services are good but the quality (boat) is not good. Don't waste your money on this product.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Review after using 3 month and update after using 6 month,5.0,"I am writing this review after using 3 month of this earphone.This earphone has good bass, sound, quality as well as noise cancellation is also good. You are not going to complain about these parameters after buying it.This earphone has sufficient length of wire which will make more comfortable while traveling or jogging.The earphone's earclip is soft and comfortable design in compared to other earphone.At first earclip generates little pain in ears but after using 1-2 week  I am comfortable with it.I got it in 499 rupees. The price of this earphone vary between 450 to 550 during sales.It is better against boat 225 in sound quality, bass.But in compared boat 225 it is not good plated and it not fully matleic (partially Matleic).As well as boat costumer care service is also good.Updated reviewIf the metallic part of earphone (3.5 mm pin cap & earphone joint part) got scratch the whole metallic part will loose the colour like a layer of paint (or like stiker)."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Nice,5.0,The best product for this price. You may get it for around 400-500. Definitely not worth the mrp cost 1500.Very decent fit and ergonomics.It has volume rockers and play/pause buttons which works on iphone android and also on win pc.A decent sound quality for thr cost.Bass lovers would hate it.Music lovers may not be impressed.But part-time listeners and best suited for callings and meetings.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),superbly AMAZING!!!!,5.0,"In this price range these earphones are simply awesome. I got boat bassheads 100, bassheads 225 and bassheads 242 and no need to mention bassheads 242 are farr better than these all with a really heavvvy bass and more balanced audio. The comfort of the earphones is incredible and you wont even feel like you  are wearing these on. Ear hooks too come handy with outdoor activities. No need to see any further reviewJUST GO FOR IT."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Awesome Earpiece,5.0,"I am using this earpiece for last 10 days and I found this one really good. Here are my observations till now. Will update you more after using for a longer period.- Sound quality is really good- Build quality is above average.- Bass is really good, didn't expected that good. Not so high not so low.- Noise cancellation works fine.- Cable length and layout is also good.- Ear clip works fine and it make this earphone sporty. Though I felt a bit pain in my ears after using it for longer period.Overall this earphone from Boat is a masterpiece in this price range in my opinion. I would definitely recommend to buy."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Low budget premium headset,5.0,"I'm not a hardcore fan of specs on headsets. However I see only build quality and durability. I have put it in my jeans , pulled it out ,. Nothing happened. It's built sturdy. For sound quality, I'm not the right person. The thing I liked is they provided with different size ear piece silicone to fit."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It's the 👑King 👑 of Budget 600.,4.0,Pros:1)Dynamic frequency response is very awesome especially in this rate 👏👏.2) If played at higher volume No Distortion at all.3) Very light (eventhough 10 mm driver)never slipped from the ear even the removal of ear wings.4) It's jack and cable Very vey durable. 👌5) Such a wonderful treble response 👏.Cons:1)The only con is missing of solid thumping bass (225 beats 242 in thumping bass).
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Warranty Issue,5.0,"I tried to reach out to their customer care and it just provide message having link for their website. There is no way of registering the complaint as it just display the service centre list as per pin code. However if you will try to contact on given number either they are wrong or not reachable.I bought their products earlier for family and experience was good in terms of quality, customer service and everything but it's getting worse now."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good earphones,4.0,"Earphones are good and comfortable, sound quality and mic is also good.I have used boat's other earphones but they are heavier and feel uncomfortable some times  but this one is light weight and I don't have any issue.The only thing I don't like about this product is the wire is not flat and gets tangled easily."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Don't buy this product. Go for some other boat earphone,2.0,1. Sound quality below expectation2. Product material poor quality3. Non-user friendlyWire quality is not good as shown. Another most important it's not user friendly product as your ears cannot bear it for longer duration. The designer must have thought of coming up with such product to ease human experience but it lacks. Sound quality is average.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst Earphone Ever had,1.0,I've been using this from last 7 months(Brought it in Feb 2021) and before completing a year one side earplug is not working ...and the sound quality is disaster ...when I plugin to my laptop it's making a noice that's so irritating that cause headache ...you can't use it for more than 2/3 hr ...I'm just fed up with this earphone ...now I can't even return or replace 😐 I would never recommend this earphone to anyone.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),...just read,3.0,"Ok so this worked reallly well. The bass was good, the sound quality was good and it was attractive. I bought this on 12th September 2020 and I'm writing on 10th October 2020. It's been around a month or so BUT thereee is some kind of loose connection at the place where the two wires come from and suddenly I can only hear the sound from the left earbud unless I hold in a very specific angle which I obviously can't. Its annoying because I love listening to music and having only 1 side is just GAH. So idk if this will happen to you also but yea"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worse product one can ever have,1.0,when i got rhe product i was kinda happy but later i realized how cheap it is.. it literally gives me headaches the high notes are way too loud... you cant just relax putting this. Please don't keep high expectations from this product. It broke my heart. My worse decision in purchasing ever.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"If you love bass, then its not for you.....",3.0,"If you are a bass lover, this is not for you.Sound quality is good though, But only till 50-60% volume. Dont go beyond that, you will thank me later.I would suggest you to buy boat airdopes 241(Only for bass lovers). They are bit pricey than this one, but are worth it for that price"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),A great budget earphone.,5.0,As per the price the earphones feel premium and are of great quality. The audio output is supreme and I love the bass of it. The noise cancellation is okay as such. They feel really sturdy and strong. The pouch given is really helpful in carrying it. We also get extra earplugs in the box which is a really nice touch. It also comes with built in mic and volume buttons which works fab. As per the price I guess it's the best in the segment. JUST GO FOR IT.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Don't go with reviews.,3.0,"I don't know about others, but personally I didn't liked it. The sound quality is very loud and noisy, I felt irritated after using it for some time. Yes the sound is clear but it's not gentle and you don't feel comfortable while listening to music. I am planning to return it. I felt the treble to be bit more than usual which results in irritation."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It's Okay,3.0,This earphone looks quite ordinary and I also don't think it's cable is tangle free as advertised.  It stays in my ear that's plus in comparison to boat basshead 225 which I had ordered along with this earphone and sound quality is good. Ear hooks are detachable but without ear hooks the tip is uncomfortable in ear so no benefit regarding that. Overall it's okay.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Full volume would hurt eardrum,1.0,Sound is not soft. Not supporting MacBook Air properly . Unable to control volume and feel like the sound is pinching in ear. Earlier I was having boat rokerz 255 and that sound was amazing. Having that impression I bought this earphone but disappointed.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Great earphones,4.0,"They're good, sound quality is clear, the base is good not like too much boosted but in the right amount. They fit in ears perfectly and don't fall off. Just the wire connecting earbuds feels thin but it's ok...Edit : after 1 year of use they are still working awesome, although some rats have chewed the wire but still they are working fine after such harsh use and being stretchedEdit 2 : the wires connecting buds are just like clay now, they get cuts out of no where, they have gotten way to soft and weak"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Trendy, bassy...",5.0,"Awesome bass. Lovely sound signature. Good noise isolation. Sweat & water resistant IPX4 rating. Trendy, sporty colours. Durable build, but everythings plastic. Packaging could be better. Nice velvety pouch."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Perfectly adjusted in the ears,4.0,"I've been suffering from this earphones problem since long, then my friend suggested me this, I bought it and the experience is soo good, best thing is it's adjusted very well in the ears, and sounds are soo good, I'd recommend to listen ""Light of the seven"" in this earphones. thanks me later."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Somewhat good,3.0,It works good with my pc but not my phone. With my phone it is not pairing sometime. Voice is excellent. Happy while using in pc but not with my phone. Sometimes it works sometimes not.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Ok quality .annoying after 10 15 mn of loud music,3.0,The first prodyct given was too loud and the have anmoying bass like 50 rs headfones....this was replaced and these one are ok. May rate 3 for thisnproduct...good for young crowd whonlike to listn loud music....not good for peole who have heavey use for calls and meetings..
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Facing Replacement delay issue from boat team,1.0,"I like the product initially with the sound quality and the fit but with in a year I was end up in mike issue and some trouble with the one side of speaker. I just try to claim the replacement and mailed to the boat support team. They got the damaged headset from me and they have tracking mechanisms for checking the status of the ticket, issue for their side is they won’t update the status properly to customer and due to covid situation I don’t think they have working technical support team to resolve my ticket. I am really frustrated in following up with them. It’s be more than 3 months and I haven’t got any proper updates. Not even replying via email"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Complete package in this price range !!,5.0,I'm still using this earphones continuously from last 5-6 months.I have to say its perfectly made finished product in this price range.Sound quality its super crystal clear sound better than its previous basshead model and also mic quality is too good.Bass is perfectly balanced you can say between medium & high level of bass just like previous model.It's build quality is amazing rough & tough.It's wires are tangle free with plastic coating so it too strong 💪.And its also water resistant that is the plus point.And at last its too stylish in look it's complete package in this price range just go for it.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not satisfied,3.0,Though Amazon workers' did a good job in delivery... The product made me to get disappointed as the audio quality is not good. Actually the product has been returned (because of the audio quality)  and got another one. But that new one is also not good.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Smooth with bass. Just the treble is a bit harsh.,4.0,"The earphones are amazing. Comfortable to wear, the wire quality is good and bass effects are smooth. The ear hooks prevent the earphones from falling from the ears. Just the problem is with the treble. When you increase the volume the treble exponentially increases and it kind of ruins the experience. But overall the earphones are good and quality of sound is clear and crisp."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Amazing bass and noise cancellation,4.0,"Boat's earphones are best in their range, no other brand provides such a quality. It's noise cancellation is also pretty good, bass is even good.Particularly this model of earpiece is amazing, as it's of sufficient length, has a clip, mic, and they have provided this very cute tiny Velvet pouch, it's too small of contain that lengthy earphones though.Provides 1 year warranty.So overall it's worth of it's price."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The Complete Boat Bassheads 242 review,4.0,"Alright, I used this product for almost a day now...To start of... I love this! 242 is amazing and truly worth it... The bass was something I would never expect for 500 and the quality makes me even more sure that this is definitely more than worth it!Pros: Quality,Bass and a few more items like the clip and the pouchCons: My right ear pains if I use it for like 3 hours or so... PS you can remove the ear hook and it should be fine and that's probably it!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Unfriendly for ears,1.0,The sound quality is not that much good As I was expected and the major concern about this headphone is it started pain on ears within just half an hour if you listen continuaslly. Not recommended at all.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Audio is crystal clear.,5.0,"The volume is high, crisp and clear. Bass is not so high, but good at this price point. The body feels premium. Mic is adequately sensitive. At this price point the earphone is good, and highly commendable."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),the low quality of the product has left me astonished.,2.0,"Product don't meet the quality of advertisement.Uncomfortable in the earProduct shouldn't be called basshead as the bass is not upto standard.Fragile plastic materialHigh frequency elements such as hihats and snares leave that agonizing shrill stinging sound.the low quality of the product has left me astonished, can't believe realme has better earphones in terms of sound quality and material than Boat."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst product and customer care,1.0,Brought this headphones in the month of June2021 and one side stopped working in the month of Oct2021… it worked hardly 6months… when tried to log a complaint in their website but was unable to … called customer care waited for 1hr (from 57 queue) at the time when I was in 3 in q they say they are busy and will give me a call.. it’s been days but no call back.Worst product and worst customer service
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not Long lasting.,1.0,"The headphones both speakers are already malfunctioning. I bought on 1st October, there's still 1 month left. The problem began after using for 6 months. It was fine in the beginning but hardly long lasting. The service centre has no space left to take up my issue for the next 1 month as all slots booked, that is 35 slots per day. Boats quality is disastrous."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),WORTHY!!,5.0,"I got this on offer by 449 Rs.All I can say after 9 months of usage that this was the best product I have ever used.I never used premium quality earphones though , I always use below 1000 Rs product.... but in this price segment This was best imo.Sound quality excellent,bass excellent it just compromises little bit in case of noise cancellation but thats ok.Thank you Amazon , Thank you BOAT for the outstanding product."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Boat is a winner,5.0,This is my 3rd boat hands free and this is the best of them. Bass is amazing and at the same time doesn't hurt your eardrums. Noise cancelation is there and it fits very well. Additional pouch to keep your hands free dirt free is delight (could have been a little bigger though). So 4.7/5 is my experience with this.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Bass and quality,2.0,I'm using boAt roackerz BT since an year and thought of buying this when I'm out of battery. But after I saw the product it completely disappointed and I didn't expect this with boAt.  It's looking like a local product and didn't feel sophisticated while using it.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best in Price,4.0,It’s worth at this price and best comparing to other earset however its not comfortable if you wear it from even an hour you ear will feel it.To add at cost of ₹399 Boat provides a pouch and ear cups which amazing.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),boAt bass heads as additional option apart from ear phone we have,3.0,"While the product is good, the earlier dispatch was incorrect and later on Amazon replaced it. The ear hook while is fibre based it’s not something which is convenient over a longer call and need to keep adjusting it. But its fixed and it doesn’t fall while on the long calls. I haven’t tried while walking or running."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good in this Price but sound is pathetic,3.0,"Hello everyone,This is really nice Earphone in this price list with one year warranty.Nice built Quality and Design but I am Disappointed because of sound Quality  which is not good..People who are looking design and good built Quality can go for it.I am Using Mi Earphone Basic with Ultra Deep Bass & Aluminum Alloy from Last 1 year and trust me this is best earphone in sound Quality..."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Waste of money and time.,1.0,"Hey everyone. I got this earphones few days back and it's mic stopped working. I tried to register a complaint on Boat since this product has one year warranty but I am unable to download it's invoice. I registered my complaint on Amazon and they promised to revert in four days, it has been more than ten days now but there is no response from their side as well. I would suggest you all not to purchase this showy product. Thanks."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good for base,4.0,"This earphone is okay in this price range. The base quality is really good and it is very good for gym. It's water resistant too. But I feel a kind of suppression in sounds because base is very high in this earphones. The mic quality is also okay okay....not soo good. And, you can't listen music all the time because after certain time it starts paining in your ears because of it's very hard quality. And yess this is tangle free"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good sound reproduction but unsatisfactory fitting.,4.0,"It gives excellent sound reproduction, cancelling all outside noises. But it does not fit well into the ear. It needs to hook on to the outer ear to fit well. As of now, it keeps falling out constantly. The present hook design is not good."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The best earphones for the price range,5.0,I am really impressed with sound quality and build quality. It has just arrived. I have tested it and couldn't resist from posting a review. I will wait for 3 months and post another review after regular usage.This will be my best friend during the lockdown :-)
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),good but....,4.0,"The headphones are sturdy, durable, and worth the money. The only thing that I think could be better is the bass level. The treble is a little on the high side so when I listen to music or watch movies, it's not comfortable at high levels. Else piece is good."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not a good brand,1.0,"This is my 2nd boat and I found it worst, product is worst manufacturing quality wise as well sound quality, don't buy this ,go for redmi brand ,sturdy and good sound quality in 400 ₹ only"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Get the bassheads 225 instead of this,1.0,First of all somehow the headphone jack didn't connect properly in the jack of my phone I had to give it to my brother cuz when I tried to return the earphones they didn't let me return or replace it at that time and it's much weaker that the bassheads 225 it doesn't even have L shaped 3.5mm jack the plastic which is used in this feels cheap compared to the 225 which ironically share the same price most of the times and sometimes even lesser than this
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),BOAT IS BEST! Premium sound at affordable prices!,5.0,"These are the 7th set of earphone/ headphone I have bought from BOAT and they just work flawlessly. Others are different models and they still work good but I felt like buying new ones for a change. As always, NO REGRETS!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Wonderful and powerful headphones under 500,5.0,"It's very good for the rate . Easy to use  , thin . I got a spirit lime color and it's awesome , especially when I go for walk it's really nice to listen to music . The earbuds are soft and colourless . If one set was in the colour of wire it would look good dashing."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Built for exercise but got ruined with sweat.,1.0,After a few days of running the sweat broke it's controls. I used it on my ipod. If i plug it intto a phone now the volume or the Google assistant starts to act up. The volume goes to max or Google assistant keeps comming up. Same with Apple. It start up siri constantly and changes the volume.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Pathetic boat,1.0,Pathetic earphone stopped working in 10 days flat. No return so your money goes down the drain. Stay away boat is one of the worst
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Very low quality earphones,2.0,The plastic around the earpiece hurts even on a very short use.Headphone jack broke with 2 months of use.I would suggest to go for other boat products as they are much better.This is unfortunately one of the bad ones they have
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),in this price it feels like heaven after using boat basshead,5.0,"All over sound quality like vocal, bass are awesome.Best feature is that earbuds are so fit in ear that you can use it anywhere like Gym, running,sports activity.After 5 month use I can say that it's awesome earphone in this price.Any other earphone under 1000 can't beat it,even boat basshead 330 wireless rs 1600 also can't beat it.Believe me it's awesomeI purchased it rs 500It's somehow similar OnePlus wireless earphone which price rs 1900"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Sound quality is good but the Bass quality are very bad,3.0,This head set's colour style features are very good but the Bass quality is very very poor. I heard some rock ..dance.. song which play very clearly but the Bass comes out very low. Otherwise the headphone is good user friendly and comfortable for ears.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Just avoid this brand,1.0,The earphones are fine as long as working. I had to replace mine after just 2 months as microphone stopped working. And when i had gone to service centre this seemed to be a common problem. Repair person didn’t even check my earphones before giving me new one. That means they are aware about the problem and issue seems to be for larger product batch. Better to avoid this brand. They have money to hire stars/cricketers for marketing but can’t maintain product quality.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Go for it,5.0,Bought this for my nephew and he loved it. The noise cancellation and bass is great. Amazing headset and the jazzy color makes it even trendy. Full marks for the complete design.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst from boat.,2.0,"Bass is missing and it distorts at full volume of a smartphone, if it can't handle full volume means drivers are not powerful enough to deliver good sound and at low volume levels like 1 or 2 from 30 it doesn't give clear audio.Stay away from this, go for Boat 225 you cam feel the bass punch in your ears."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),boAt bassheads 225 are much better!,1.0,"Sound quality is good. But only the sound quality doesn't matter. The ear hooks got loose in just a week and it even comes out if you keep your headphones in your pocket. The clip when mounted, bends the wire. The 3.5mm plug is not L-shaped and at times its very hard to unplug it from the device as the grip is small.Sound quality is good but think about the above before you buy."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Compact and handy with decent sound quality,4.0,"Everything is fine for me from sound quality to comfort. But I received damaged box I don't now whether it is due to packaging or seller intenstionally send this but overall the earphone are in very good condition . I had used headphone before so I found a vast sound difference but if you are like me looking for compact and easy to carry thing ,then you can go for it."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not at all good sound quality neither bass nor treble in balance,3.0,"Well the built quality is okay but I do not understand why there are so many positive reviews regarding these earphones since there are many others better and cheaper than these however I was fooled by reviews otherwise I would have gone with my Mi basics that are cheaper and much superior to these in terms of sound quality, so do not buy them if you are conscious about sound quality otherwise the built quality is okay of these headphones and I would update my comment after using these for sometime on durability and all"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),One side is not working,1.0,Product delivered and I opened box plugged that headphone into phone and one side of the headphone is not working .what a worst😡 product.dont buy it by seeing offers .One of the worst service of Amazon delivery delay . Don't buy it the service is worst by Amazon
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst handling and pathetic delivery But excellent product in first impression,5.0,In first impression Sound quality and Bass were excellent at this price point (400₹) and boat had places extra buds of small large size along with medium size attached to earphones and finally a small pocket size bag to place the earphones But delivery speed was pathetic maybe indian post will deliver faster than amazon normal delivery even package handling was worst package was crushed like there is nothing in there but luckily earphones were good and they sounds exceptional
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Got replacement......good for value,4.0,Not worth more than 200rs. Packet was damaged and opened by someone before me. Earphone had scratches as if it is refurbished and not new.Edit: REPLACEMENT UNIT WAS UPTO THE MARK. QUITE NICE BUT CERTAINLY NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS....GOOD FOR GYM.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good one,4.0,The sound clarity and quality is really nice.. One drawback is the ear buds are getting dettached frequently and its not much sturdy.. Otherwise its good to use.. Noise cancellation is also good..
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Product Worth The Price,5.0,"I giftes this go my sister on Rakshabandhan and she was more than happy to receive it. The earphones are really good with an attractive neon green color, boat icon on both sides and comfortable to wear. Well, even the sound quality is satisfactory. I should say, the best product from such a good brand - Boat, that too in a very economical price. So, you can go for it!"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Boat makes the worst wired earphones.,3.0,Boat makes the worst wired earphones. Within 2months of purchase the mic stopped working and earlier i also used Boat baseheads 152 which stopped working from the left side within 4month of use and i was not even able to return/replace it to boat as their customer care number does'nt work.I wrote them emails but their was no reply.Boat's wired earphones are not durable even if you use it carefully..Go for skull candy or Jbl instead.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good Job!,5.0,"Value for money - got myself 2 this time. I love the ear hooks; infact, I have been buying Boat ear phones for quite sometime now - never been disappointed. The ear hooks are a winner; you can't manage a ear phone without the hooks - they are a must to tame the ear phone."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Can't hear sound from left side,1.0,"I cant hear sound from left side of it, and the return and exchange offer was only for till 7 August and I found problem in it on 12 August, there is no boat showroom near me. Please exchange it if possible. 😓"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Disappointed,1.0,I loved the product in fact i ordered multiple times however every it didnt last more than two month both ordered Boat Earphone wire broke apart idk it happend to me frequently. I've no compromise with its internal quality but its wiring is disappointing 😔
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Don't buy,1.0,Totally waste of money I bought this ear phone on 22nd Jan 2021 na now(in the month of June) it's not working. One side of the ear phone drop dead n other works very low plus the earphone is making disturbing noises. Don't ever buy this phone. I like to claim my warrenty it will be a great help if amazon help me out with the process.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),It's a value for money,4.0,"Overall it's a gud headset with a more than decent sound quality. However , keep the volume somewhere at 70 % it will give u awesome experience.I am die hard JBL user and must say these headset are beyond expectations neck to neck with JBL signature ... Nice one"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good product,5.0,"Its a very good product at this price. The voice quality and noise cancyid super. It is durable and comfy yo use. Genuine, you get the product replaced if in guarantee period."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Very low performance....boaring sound quality,2.0,"Basshead 100 earphone much better than it. Basa quality not good at all. In my view it is a cheating item. I also use basshead100 which is more comfortable than it. I fall in impress by seeing site review, but now feel that only 5/8 preplanned reviews among more than lakhs not saying truth. Hope Amazon take care of it.L"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Better than bassheads 225,4.0,I switched from Skullcandy to boatMy first purchase from boatFully satisfied with the product qualityGood cable lengthCable is Fully hardened10mm drivers done their jobIn line mic is good and volume Rocker is very handy to control volumeComes with 2 extra pairs of buds and 1 earhooksVery light weightAfter using sometime u forget that there is something in earsThough plastic housing for drivers they are of good qualityIf u are choosing between 225 and 242 go for 242225 comes out of the box with metal buds and they are bit heavy in earsComing to sound quality 4/5 cuz previously I used SkullcandySome drops during playing lowsBass is goodWorth for money
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Very nice,5.0,This is a very good earphone in this range..bass and sound quality is so good..u can't expect more in this range..it's durability is amazing..this sky colour looks so beautiful..go for it and u will not be disappointed 🙂
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good in all aspects EXCEPT the first half of wire is very thin and delicate.,4.0,It fits perfectly in ear and also looks wise its good. One big problem is that the wire between the ear piece and the connector is very very thin and I am just afraid that it might break anytime so extra care is needed.They say its strong braided wire but its a play... only the wire between connector and joint is thick and strong but that part of wire generally never breaks.So its good in all aspects but the only requirement is for you to handle it with extreme care.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Don't buy orange color,4.0,"I have two earphones both same model 242 one is neon and other is orange, neon have better wire quality while orange is worst eve plastic of orange earphone is bad and it got got damage from many side in 4 months while neon is still in same conditionas it was 8 months ago. Although sound is same and both are working but don't buy orange one its material is not good go for neon or black you will be fully satisfied."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),The best in market,5.0,"I wanted to purchase an earphone with a decent sound quality and I generally prefer listening to music with high trebble and base. Honestly, this is what I wanted. A perfect product to buy under this price range. In my personal opinion, just dont go for earphones worth 2k-3k, they are waste of money and I bet this earphone gives a tough competition to those expensive craps. This one is more than enough I must say."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good but not the best,4.0,The sound quality is average. Mic is great. If u are more into calls then this one is a better deal because the position of mic is very much where your mouth is not in the middle like most earphones . Its a good product in 300-400 range. Don't buy it if price is more than 400

I don't think they will replace it with new one after lockdown I'll try to avail my warranty.If they replace it I'll update here.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Really Good Product,5.0,If you need a basic headphone then this is really great. The sound quality of Boat products have always been impressive. The mic is also good and well placed. The cord is long enough. Overall a good buy.

I listen to a lot of rock, metal and EDM tracks, sometimes at pretty loud volumes. There have been many instances when I had unintentionally pulled its wire. I have exercised, jogged and freshened up while wearing these. And still, there have been no damages whatsoever because of rough use, water splashing or loud continuous bass.Would definitely recommend to anyone in this price range."

NIETHER THE BASS IS GOOD NOR THE CLEARITY EVEN IF U PUT FULL VOLUME IT'S DOESN'T SOUND LIKE I ARE IN FULL VOLUME.OVER ALL I FEEL CHEATED WITH DESCRIPTION,I HAD USED BOAY BASS EAR FONES EARLIER IT WAS GOOD BUT THIS IS REALLY BAD REALLY BAD."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Okay.,4.0,"No complaints about my boat's bass heads 242 model except for its Easy Access Controls (or in-line controls) which started malfunctioning on me for whatever reasons. Neither could I regulate the volume with Easy Access Controls nor could I play/pause during media playbacks. This happens most often if not every single time. Also, another malfunction of it being, at times, device fails to recognize the earphones at the time it's plugged in. Overall, I would give it a four star out of five."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Great product,4.0,"Good quality earphones. Heavy bass and sound. Fits perfectly for my ears. But it clogs my ears. Once i fit it, i cant hear anything outside. Its not a noise cancellation technique , its just the earphones dont leave any space for airbreathing inside the ears. Otherwise wonderfull product. Nice colours."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),GREAT FOR THE PRICE,4.0,After two week of use my personal review is that this earphone is great for both watching movies and playing games.The noise cancellation is great and bass is awesome too but the mic records a lot of background noise otherwise the product is great.I bought it for 542 but now the price is reduced to 399.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best one considering every aspects at this orive range.,4.0,Has a crispy soud quality. Good for melodious romantic songs. Adequate bass. But the quality of the bass could be improved. Good built quality but wire would have been better. Such wire may be tangle free but does not lasts long. Most import thing is the position of in line mic and volume control wich is not available in most of the products at even higher prices.

I absolutely loved the Boat sound but these headphones were a disappointment that I had to return them. There was very minimal bass and sound clarity was like the earphones u get inside a flight. I had to get these cause the boat 450 broke blame it on plastic build quality and the Boat 100 stopped working. But I would pick the Boat 100 anytime if you want a good budget earphone.

Boat really gave a valuable product to their coustomer"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Not value for money,3.0,"When you're in closed room than you can feel the bass, but when you're on the go driving or outside you won't get that bass as outside noise would make loud music down.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"loud sound, low bass",3.0,"Bass is super low, it can be only heard on full volumes, and listing on full volumes can be bad since the earphones are pretty loud.In build quality on the main wire is of very good quality, but the rest of the build is quite bad.overall its fine for the price but dont justifies the name basshead."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),In-Ear extensions are removable!,5.0,Fell for the color at once but i was paranoid about the in-ear extensions. I read a couple of reviews which said that it can be uncomfortable while lying down but they are removable and the earphones can be used as regular earphones while not working out or running.The bass is obviously very good as the name suggests. Mic is sensitive enough. Sound is crisp and clear.I think its a good choice for the price range. (Got it for 500 INR)
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Overall good if not the best,4.0,All is good except it's transparent rubber hook which keeps falling off from its position. It's uncomfortable when every time to put it back to its place

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best wierd earphone .,3.0,I loved this product & even packaging was very good ...... price is little High....we can get this thing ...under 450.rs ..but any way product is good if you are looking for a wired earphones 🎧 little costly but worth it.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),One of the WORSE budget earphones,2.0,"Don't get fooled by the reviews. The build quality is worse, the earphones are glued. The base is boosted a lot by default, which is completely distorted ( not balanced). The bass suppresses the treble and the earphone kinda vibrates which is very annoying. Most of the reviewers are new buyers or they barely seem to know anything about music."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worst,1.0,I want to tell you that don't go for this piece because my one side of this earphone stopped working just after 2-3 weeks and I am ver disappointed from this. The sound quality is adorable but this issue I faced has totally filled hate for this product. Not expected this from you boat.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Best at this price range. Great colour options,5.0,This is the best and most stylish earphone at this range. It gives great sound quality (for normal not so intensive users like me) and also comes with a good warranty. Also many many good colours are available as options.Just buy it. Unlike many at this price range it has separate buttons for pause/play and changing sound levels.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),"Overall good but noise cancellation of mic is just okay, sound quality is good",4.0,"It is useful to listen music or for any day to day conversation, it seems little heavy, but it is really good during sports activities, it has very tight grip, Mic should be good, can't record any audio if connected with PC or Laptop, only best if you use it with mobile"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worth to buy but not for rough use.,4.0,"Bought it 3 ½ months back, sound quality is more what you would expect. But left side of bud starts giving flat sound instead of bass. I claimed for warranty now I'm get replaced with new one without any charges"
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Go for it,4.0,I like the earphones. They are pretty much good at this price. But the only one thing is my ears started to pain for longer hours of wearing. The sound is good. Basically I am not a bass listener. So i don't need it much. Over all you can take it at this budget
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Sound quality is not good.,3.0,Worst noise cancellation. Sound quality is not justifying the price. I felt like listening with road side earphones. Bass is okay.I can sense some disturbance even with HQ music.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Product is good but seller is making people full and selling 100 rupee quality product @500,1.0,The seller is selling fake product at the name of original one...They are selling fake products literally of 100 rupees ear phone sound quality..Thanks Amazon they have return policy..I am returning my earphone..Better to buy from some other seller

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Good noice cancellation,4.0,"I like the 'basis, it is good enough to cancel the outside noice.

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Doesn't fit to the ear,2.0,The earphone is so big doesn't fit it ear the sound quality is also not so good enough.. not recommended
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Super quality from boat,5.0,More efficient than boat bassheads 225 as it has volume control buttons with pause and play button and stick to ear better than 225 and the sound quality is very good and in 449 it is value for money. I will recommend this product for people to wish to buy wired earphones under 500.Sound quality is very good as i have used it for 2 months its functioning good till date. Noise cancellation is better than boat bass heads 225.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Great as expected from boAt.,5.0,They have improved sound quality a lot. Some pple disliked it but it has even better bass so don't worry. Close your eyes and tune into nirvana.Edit: That black pouch bag is really handy and looks great.
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Poorly designed,1.0,"It's rough on the ears, it hurts just to wear it as the material is inflexible and kinda rough."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Satisfied,5.0,I am totally satisfiedSound quality is great and the thing i like the most about this earphones is it's weightIt's so light weight you will not not even feel like wearing any earphones..very much comfortable but you cannot use it for too long...when i use it for more than two hours continuously it starts hurting my ears
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Overall it is a nice product,4.0,I have to say product is very good in both build and sound quality but in sound 'treble' is worst then I expected treble is bad I can't imagine from this brand. I have to paly this in 70-80% maximum volume otherwise sound will get very noisy. So think twice before buying this product.

But you have to be careful any earphones."
boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),not worth to money,3.0,"I bought this exactly one year before , now its working only one ear like other cheap quality product. I didn't expect this from boat. Before this i used skullcandy earphone for 3 years and was superb."

boAt Bassheads 242 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Carbon Black),Worth Buying ♥️,5.0,Its a very nice product for regular use & for sports person. I also have a Boat Rockerz 600 Kunal Rawal Edition so I should not compare that one with this because that is superb but it is also nice as a earphone in this range and it also has a nice bass & it is better that boat bassheads 225.
